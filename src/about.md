I'm a creative at heart. I apply my talent for problem solving to things that have to do with technology and learning. I still occasionally weild a 🎸 guitar or 📷 camera, and still have a muscle memory for Adobe shortcuts to help design the occassional logo or poster. I dabble in code, building simple websites — like this one.

I would describe myself as an Expert Generalist with skills spanning graphic design, multimedia, web design, project leadership, visual communication, user experience, eLearning, online systems, interface design and information architecture.  
  
Currently, I am the Manager of Learning Design and Content in the Online Programs Team at the University of Adelaide. Previously I was at Charles Sturt University, where I also held various roles relating to the implementation, development and production of eLearning resources and systems. Before that, I spent several years in commercial graphic design, working in a variety of roles in print and marketing in Australia and Europe.  
  
I have a keen interest in innovation and developing and implementing new technologies within an educational context to enhance the learning experience. I believe that technology offers a range of unique opportunities to actualise a range of pedagogical and instructional approaches which can revolutionise the education sector. I love the challenge that new technology brings and the creative process involved in developing an idea through to implementation.  
  
Working at the nexus of technology and education, I have developed a skill for translating ideas, concepts and goals into technological solutions that improve the user experience. I am a skilled communicator who works especially hard to translate ‘tech speak’ into something tangible and understandable.  
  
Always open to new opportunities, I have been working to establish a broad and international personal learning network by working in the open, engaging in social media, writing academically, presenting at conferences and blogging extensively. At the same time, I have become increasingly fluent in leadership responsibilities, large-scale projects and team management. I am poised for further change and growth and ready to seize the next big opportunity.
