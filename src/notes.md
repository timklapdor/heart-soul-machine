I came across the concept of **Evergreen Notes** via [Steph Ango's](https://stephango.com/evergreen-notes) blog. The idea rang true for me and resonated with some of the ideas I worked through during the [Federated Wiki Happening](https://fedwikihappening.rodwell.me/view/happening-folks). The concept is  articluated really well by Steph:

> Evergreen notes allow you to think about complex ideas by building them up from smaller composable ideas.

So with the development of this blog I wanted to create this notes space to extract ideas out of their original contexts in order for them to become reference points for larger complex ideas.
