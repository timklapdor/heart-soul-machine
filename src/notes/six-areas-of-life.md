From the [[Focus Course]] we were introduced to the **6 Areas of Life**. Each area influences others and we tend to focus our mind and attention to different areas at times in our life. These areas were used to discuss and develop our goals during the course across a time span of Someday, 5 Years, 1 Year, 1 Month, 1 Week and Today. This helped me develop more holistic and practical goals than I've ever had - from the aspirational to the actionable.
