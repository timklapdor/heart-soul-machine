I think this is a really nice differentiation to remember: 

> **Remember: a resolution is an activity, not a goal**. My 10X business goal for this year is not a resolution. _The resolutions are what will help me achieve that goal_. “Lose 10 pounds” is a goal. “No snacking after 7pm” is a resolution.
