Default. According to Homer Simpson the two sweetest words in the English dictionary.

> The default is what defines the space. No matter how flexible the room and the furniture in it is, it has to have a default position. No matter how flexible the space is, it has to have a starting point, a point zero that it can return to. It’s this default that defines what the space is, how it is perceived, how it is defined and inevitably how it will be used.
> 
> The simple reason is that _people rarely move beyond the default_.
> 
> Yes, the room may have a million-and-one configurations, but the reality is people stick with what’s there. They won’t move anything because they are used to the notion that _the choice has already been made_. That **the default isn’t a starting point, but the end of a designed process**. That someone else with more skills has looked at all this and made decisions on our behalf, whether this is true or not.
> 
> I get the reasoning behind the default. It’s something that’s necessary because decisions can’t be made all the time. There’s a cognitive load related to making decisions that is often at the expense of focussing on what really matters. Yes configurations are important, but at what cost and for what benefit?

The simple reason is that _people rarely move beyond the default_.
