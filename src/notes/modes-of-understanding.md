From a presentation by Bret Victor, The Humane Representation of Thought,  the *Modes of Understanding* is a simple description of the ways that humans can gain an understanding. It is a meta-model, pulling together the ideas from Bruner, Gardner and Egan.

These Modes of Understanding should be seen as distinct from **[[Types of Learning]]**, although they are connected. The *Modes* are ways that we interact with information, how it can be presented and ways that we can make meaning of things, whereas the *Types* outline the processes in which we can take that information in and connect it to our schema. Rather than compete, the two concepts should live side by side. 

*For example, we might want to engage in Assimilative Learning and then use the Modes to choose how to present that information - using a Visual means.*
