A simple conditional statement that forms the basis for much of programming. 

> **IF** - a condition - **THIS** - is met **THEN** perform **THAT** task

This simple statement can be augmented using ELSE or OR to develop multiple options based on the specific condition being met. 

I use this often as a short-hand for basic programming (the stuff I am capable of doingÂ ðŸ˜ƒ!)
