The fire changed the trajectory of our lives - my wife, 3 year old child and mine. It kickstarted and epic battle to rebuild our house and deal with a recalcitrant insurance company that admitted no fault to their incredibly poor service and behaviour. We finally got the house rebuilt, but not without living in "temporary" accommodation for two years and needing to drag the insurance company to the ombudsman. 

In hindsight the stress was enourmous and painful and had a hugely detrimental impact on my health and wellbeing. We "won" but the toll was heavy. 

The[ blog post from that day](https://timklapdor.wordpress.com/2015/09/25/the-fire/) was written stream of conscience and was a way of recording and processing the day.
