From what I've gathered in doing the research is that the design is adapted from the original concept designed by Richard Buckmeister Fuller, an American architect, designer, inventor and futurist. The design is made out of large triangles that fit together into heagons to create a self-supporting structure with spacious open plan living areas. A local Australian outfit - Glencor - manufactured the Hexadome as an alternative kit home. Panels were contructed off site, trucked in and lifted into place.
