The Cynefin Framework provides a conceptual framework to make sense of the world around us. The revised framework (I'm old school where it was just four!)five decision-making contexts or "domains"â€”

1. Simple^[known as simple until 2014, then obvious until being recently renamed]
2. Complicated
3. Complex
4. Chaotic
5. Confusion

These different domains help identify situations and make sense of our own and other people's behaviour and other forces at play. 

I've found the first four domains incredibly useful in gaining an understanding of why things often don't work or play out the way they were intended - usually because they are framed or rolled out in the wrong domain.
