A **connected curriculum** is the idea of a data informed design of courses and programs. Thinking wholistically, the process is bi-directional with the initial program design informing courses, and courses then feeding back information on how they have been developed. 

An example of the kind of information that would inform a Connected Curriculum would be:

- Novice to mastery map for:
    - Graduate attributes
    - Program specific skills 
    - Program topics and knowledge
- Knowledge and skills assessment
- Assessment processes and methodology
- Assessment artefacts and desired outcomes
- Collaboration and cooperation opportunities
- Work integrated Learning
- Industry collaboration and input
- Topic Maps and Learning Schema
