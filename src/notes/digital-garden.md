summary: A philosophy for publishing personal knowledge on the web that draws on the metaphor of the garden – a space that grows and changes over time as opposed to the 'stream' of linear and time based posts.

A philosophy for publishing personal knowledge on the web. 

> They’re not following the conventions of the “personal blog,” as we’ve come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.
> 
> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren’t strictly organised by their publication date. They’re inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren’t refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They’re less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we’re used to seeing.

> At the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network, Mike Caufield delivered a keynote on [The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY&feature=emb_logo). It later becomes [a hefty essay](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) that lays the foundations for our current understanding of the term. If anyone should be considered the original source of digital gardening, it’s Caufield. They are the first to lay out this whole idea in poetic, coherent words.
> 
> Caufield makes clear digital gardening is not about specific tools – it’s not a Wordpress plugin, Gastby theme, or Jekyll template. It’s a different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information - one that accumulates personal knowledge over time in an explorable space.

“The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.”
