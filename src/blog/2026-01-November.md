## The Vibe
The first couple of weeks of November we were in a post-Japan haze. I love how travel seeps into your pores and you experience it beyond the time itself. The vibe after Japan was a feeling of grief and longing. I really loved being in nature and the hustle of the city, the food and the freedom of being away from work. 

That said, I didn't spend that much time pining, as I was off to New Zealand fairly quickly for the [ICDE World conference](https://www.icdeworldconference2025.com/). I'd been to Wellington before, back in 2012 for an Ascilite Conference, and had only ever seen the city itself - and that's about it for the whole of the North Island. This time I had a bit more time to explore the city itself, but I also hired a car and set out to explore some of the countryside as well. I drove out to Cape Palliser, climbed up to the lighthouse, explored a couple of the villages, found Rivendell, and most enjoyably – Brewtown. I really loved the city too – it has this kind of grungy side that lets the independent shops, bars and breweries to exist and thrive. The conference was great too, where I made new contacts, met some IRL and reconnected with some old colleagues and friends. 

I came back tired! The conference was full on, a lot was going on at work with the merger and in the Common Core course. Add to that the stream of end-of-year and end-of-university events that populated the calendar and a weekend spent writing up a job application, and I ended the month feeling like I'd lost a lot of sleep and needed to catch up. 
## Events

The big events for me were the string of presentations and conferences that occurred in relatively quick succession. It kicked off with [This One Goes to 11(ty)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9AtVi2h5UE) as part of the Reclaim Open event. I did that early in the morning from home in Adelaide, worked, flew to New Zealand and backed up being on the Plenary Panel the next morning (lacking a few hours of sleep!). I didn't end up presenting at ICDE, but attended the pre-conference workshop day and most of the sessions, which meant some very long days. Luckily, when we finished up, I could head to Garage Project, which had kicked off Pickle Week and had a couple of glorious pints of pickle beer on the balcony with Ann-Marie. Also had a lovely dinner with Jocosta and friends. 

I also presented live at the [OER Camp](https://oercamp.de/) event, which was really nice and an interesting event, while also prepping slides and a group presentation of our Ascilite paper for the following week. 

Family-wise, it was pretty relaxed – very home-centric – and Frankie turned 4.
