    <summary>Some thoughts on an Agency Spectrum and reflecting on what agency means for me and my work.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Somewhat buried in this problematic article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.highagency.com/?__readwiseLocation=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;High Agency — In 30 Minutes&lt;/a&gt; by George Mack, is a solid idea here around Agency. I&#39;m not a huge fan of the writing style and the armchair psychology used throughout. Some of the explanations, analogies and metaphors leave a lot to be desired - but at the heart of it is something useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mack outlines that there is a &lt;strong&gt;Spectrum of Agency&lt;/strong&gt;, high to low, that tends to inform and elicit certain behaviours and traits. Mack defines these as skills (which I&#39;m not sure they are) and has an odd list of &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; traits of High Agency people - so I am having to put aside a great deal of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of it, he describes High Agency as a combination of three distinct things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bias to action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disagreeability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also suggests that High agency is like a tricycle in that if you remove one of the wheels, it stops working.  I tend to agree with the following in terms of how these display a sense of high agency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they can&#39;t think clearly, they will charge ahead with the first bad plan that pops into their head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they lack a bias for action, they&#39;ll never move their ideas from theory into the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they aren&#39;t disagreeable, they&#39;ll quit and conform when someone in authority tells them &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next part about High Agency software and Wilbur Wright is a bit of a bunk for me. So I&#39;ll skip to the Low Agency traps - which are essentially the opposite behaviours of High Agency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muddy Thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bias to inaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agreeability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These traits of Low and High Agency resonate because they&#39;re manifest in the work I&#39;m involved in at the moment. A big chunk of the merger involves trying to work with colleagues who come from a different culture and ways of working, and I would say that Agency is a key aspect of the underlying differences between our teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent years cultivating a high agency environment within my team, and I have also had that as a key part of my role within the organisation, but at the moment that&#39;s not how we&#39;re operating. There is an ongoing lack of clarity around our work and no desire to seek clarity. There is little to no action possible because it&#39;s all tied to low agentic decision-making processes (everything is decided by a committee that doesn&#39;t include our voice or even acknowledge it). Finally, there is no appetite for conflict. We cannot push back on decisions or even raise valid concerns. Any disagreement or dissent is just waved away in favour of agreeability with whatever the status quo so we don&#39;t rock the boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The takeaway from this article is around the spectrum. It helped me see my current work environment with more clarity, but it has me thinking about agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it a skill? Is it behaviour? Is it culture? What creates and disables agentic behaviours?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>March 2025</title>
    <link href="https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/04-01-march-2025/"/>

    <summary>End of Q1 for 2025! I didn&#39;t blog much - but I was out in the world - reading, listening and watching too.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vibe for March was hot and dry. We&#39;ve been inundated with a burst of hot weather late into the summer this year and a severe lack of rain. The Hills have run dry - anyone on tank water is now out of it, and the garden is looking parched and burnt. I am not a gardener of any sort, so I haven&#39;t really tried to do anything with the garden during this period - it&#39;s a bit of survival of the fittest. But for that reason, I think I&#39;ll have a bit of cleaning up I do once the weather cools down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the heat had a bit to do with my lack of buying into the &amp;quot;Mad March&amp;quot; feeling this year. Sure, all the standard events were on, but it wasn&#39;t overly motivated to get out there. Part of that was the &amp;quot;Cost of Living Crisis&amp;quot; now starting to bite. We&#39;ve had our mortgage at a fixed rate for a few years, and that time is up at the end of the month. We&#39;ve been trying to budget for that new reality, which has much less discretionary money to spend. It&#39;s not as much fun, but it&#39;s better for us in the longer term. Every purchase requires a second thought, which has left me with a deep appreciation of how much we already have and how susceptible we are to marketing and hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a bit more time at home I&#39;ve been trying to get myself more organised. Part of that has been doing a pretty radical cleanup in Obsidian, my second brain. I&#39;ve let myself be pretty experimental with how I use the tool, having a place to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;write  everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was really the key for me. But it&#39;s gotten very unruly in terms of where things live and how it&#39;s organised. I&#39;ve done a bit more work on the Johnny Decimal course – sorting out some other areas of life, and while I haven&#39;t got to a point where it&#39;s all sorted and working I can see progress. I&#39;m hoping that this work can then drive some other effort this year – basically getting the world around me into a more organised state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That drive for organisation is probably a result of the ongoing chaos at work. I&#39;m still filling the role of Curriculum and Educational Developer - a pretend-and-only-on-paper role within the curriculum development process for the new university. We&#39;re now about 35 weeks into that process, and not once have we actually provided any meaningful feedback into the process. Now things aren&#39;t going as well as planned. So, at the moment, I&#39;m having a very solid &amp;quot;See! I told you so!&amp;quot; moment – while also stuck in a system where I cannot change or influence what is happening. That&#39;s despite the fact that there is apparently a &amp;quot;continuous improvement&amp;quot; process, which doesn&#39;t seem to be very continuous or capable of improving much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, I got brought on to a couple of other projects, which have been more engaging and played to my strengths. One has been outlining the curriculum for a course on entrepreneurship and design thinking, which will form part of six courses that will be part of the Common Core of the new university curriculum. These will be a suite of, for want of a better term, &#39;Mandatory Electives&#39; - three courses every student must complete at the new university. This stage was working with a large stakeholder group to define what the course should be – aims, goals and course learning outcomes. I enjoyed the deep engagement with a topic I&#39;m really interested in and the collaboration required to get a consensus within the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That work has led into now planning out the resourcing and development process for creating these courses. This is something I&#39;ve come to reflect on as a strength of mine. I&#39;ve been able to apply my past experiences and the successes I&#39;ve had in doing this. That success part is something I don&#39;t feel I&#39;ve got a lot of credit or kudos for within the organisation... but every project I&#39;ve led we&#39;ve delivered and almost uniformly within the timeframe and budget I developed. I was hoping to do this months ago with the curriculum development but got completely sidelined in that process by. This time though I&#39;m at least at the table. There is a lot to navigate to get anything I have proposed up and running – and then there&#39;s the actually doing – but I am hopeful that I can move into this project into the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also been working on the initial discussions for the Online unit and what that might look and operate like. It&#39;s been another great group to work with, and I heard the stories, experiences, and lessons learned from all sides of both universities. I loved the honesty and the safe space that was created so that we could share not only what worked but what failed and sucked about the process. I did pitch the idea of treating online as a Campus – ensuring you have the right infrastructure, spaces for students, services, and access – and the idea of maintenance and cleaning services as well. There is such a hidden burden when it comes to technology around maintenance, particularly at an institutional level where every system seems to be treated as a one-off purchase, and that&#39;s it – &amp;quot;What do you mean there&#39;s upkeep?&amp;quot;. The reaction from the group and the thinking this enabled was really gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final thing I want to add – I wrote a business plan. Not a pretend Business Canvas – I mean a fully fledged 27-page business plan. There&#39;s an associated spreadsheet and everything! One of the things I&#39;ve been working on throughout Q1 2025 is getting this thing together in order to progress developing up a piece of software we created while working at UoA. We tried to develop it internally, but the merger canned that process – so now we&#39;re looking at taking what we have and developing as an external business. The commercialisation part of the university is still interested in our product, but in order to progress, we had to have a viable business plan to present to them. It was no mean feat pulling this thing together – but it&#39;s done now – just requiring a few added details from the team. We need to work on a name, we have a Project X name for the time being - but I am keen to share more about what we are planning and to work out loud through this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To kick off March, I went along to one of the Writers Week sessions hosting a conversation with Kara Swisher, who was on tour promoting her latest book. I&#39;ve been a long-time listener to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/pivot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pivot Podcast&lt;/a&gt; and enjoyed the dialogue and conversation between Galloway and Swisher. I get the critique of them as individuals, but in terms of voices outside my bubble, I can handle them and do find some occasional nuggets of wisdom. During the talk Swisher made an off-hand remark about Silicon Valley being a&lt;br /&gt;
Mirrortocracy rather than a Meritocracy which did stick with me. Their aim is not to elevate the best, but simply perpetuates the system that brought them to power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the following weekend it was off to WOMAD festival for our now traditional Dad and Daughter day. There weren&#39;t any huge acts on the Sunday we went and it was warm, so it was kind of nice to just sit and chill and wander around the stages. We watched&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew Gurruwiwi Band - A Reggae/Aboriginal fusion band&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bala Desejo - exceptionally good-looking Brazilians doing latin fusion/style hopping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etran de l&#39;Aïr - Toureg rockers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Grant - Piano man crooner with fantastic lyrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protoje &amp;amp; The Indiggnation - modern reggae - rock guitars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sun Ra Arkestra - old school jazz vibes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O. – bass saxophone on midi control + drums two-piece&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talisk - Scottish folk/house&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TEK TEK Ensemble - Aussie fusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yemi Alade - Nigeria&#39;s Beyonce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nils Frahm - Electronic alchemist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finishing up in the cool of the night chilling out to Nils Frahm was highlight of the event, but I loved seeing the variety of music on offer. I&#39;m glad my daughter gets to experience more than the pop-menu of sterilised top 40 music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs K and I celebrated 25 years together on St Patrick&#39;s Day, so we had a lovely treat on the weekend and headed to the McLaren Vale to the Salopian Inn for an amazing long lunch. I&#39;m still trying to get my head around 25 years, but it&#39;s been a fantastic journey together through life so far. It is crazy thinking about our time together and I am getting a flashback sequence similar to the Up! movie (obviously without the dying bit, but am resonating with a grumpier old man being developed!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next weekend was pretty chilled and relaxing. For the first time in a long while I actually sat down and read a book - it had paper and everything. A friend lent me their copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/systems-thinking-social-change-consequences/dp/160358580x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Systems Thinking For Social Change&lt;/a&gt;; while I&#39;m very aware of systems thinking, I&#39;ve never really gone in-depth with it. It was a nice change just to sit and read, something I&#39;ve been meaning to spend more time doing. The next day Mother-In-Law came to town and we had a great family. dinner down at Henley Beach and were rewarded with a great sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a look and had a quick test of an eBike as an alternative for the daily commute and to get a bit more activity baked into daily life that doesn&#39;t require the car. We are blessed with trails all around us which I&#39;ve only explored some of. The quickest way from our place to the city is on the trails through the conservation park, so I tested that out on my hybrid bike, but the seating position and lack of dual suspension made the downhill ride feel a bit precarious. So I&#39;ve been looking at what they&#39;re calling an eBike SUV (namely the &lt;a href=&quot;https://specializedretail.com.au/products/tero-x-5-0-29-200358?variant=49332131463443&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Specialized Turbo Tero X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.focus-bikes.com/au_en/bikes/e-allround/thron2-eqp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Focus Thron² EQP&lt;/a&gt;) as they have mountain bike DNA but some of the luxuries of a commuter (built-in lights, mudguards and pannier rack). I tried out the Specialized and it was impressive just on the flat in terms of feel and comfort. Will have to see what I can find price wise, and also end of trip facilities at the University in order to fit into my daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followed this up with a nice family weekend. Spent some time with Ms 13 in the city and went and saw the Viking hoard exhibition on in town. Wrapped up March with an outstanding Chinese feast at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/timklapdor/albums/72177720323546892&quot; title=&quot;2025&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54423984088_61b92cd53e_b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; alt=&quot;2025&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watched&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super Rugby Pacific is getting a good run at the moment and we&#39;re part way through both Severence and White Lotus. Managed to finish these though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt9288030/episodes/?season=3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Reacher Season 3&lt;/a&gt; - I do enjoy the series and the mix of physical violence and whodunnit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0068182/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&lt;/a&gt; - Thought I should watch some more of Hertzog&#39;s films. This was such an odd movie and exemplifies the real change over time of what acting looks like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month I blogged a lot less, but read a lot more. Here&#39;s some recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-state-of-the-culture-2024&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The State of the Culture, 2024&lt;/a&gt; actually inspired a blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/03-09-being-broken/&quot;&gt;Being Broken&lt;/a&gt;. I really loved this bringing together of the physical, psychological and technological aspects of life to describe a state that really resonates with me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-03-16-one-thing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Do One Thing&lt;/a&gt; - while we&#39;re not in an authoritarian state just yet (elections happening in May here in Australia), this simple cause to action was just a nice reminder that we have agency - even if it&#39;s to just do one thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://newsocialist.org.uk/transmissions/ai-the-new-aesthetics-of-fascism/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJEHZlleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHUMVK-6m0w6gVdG7LlfEkwDJLdZN9SqpQVzL0b7Q8_Z11M0ky97JL-V7DQ_aem_vG5OS-9p6-iq25As-pBTsA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;AI The New Aesthetics of Fascism&lt;/a&gt; - lots of very quotable sections within this, with this being great summary of the article&#39;s gist –  &amp;quot;It&#39;s embarrassing, destructive, and looks like shit: AI-generated art is the perfect aesthetic form for the far right.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://djon.es/memex/sense/Distribution/subsidiarity.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Subsidiarity&lt;/a&gt; - was really nice to read a post from David (who also has an amazing memory and reminded me of Bunya nuts!). This is a great piece that introduced me to subsidiarity, but also to why it&#39;s improbable to be something that would happen within Higher Education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/15/3/365&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Learning Maps&lt;/a&gt; is interesting - but the article is too theorhetical and lacks any real examples of the process or output. Could be useful to consider when it comes to Learning Design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Listened&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrapped up a couple of really good podcasts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2026/01/01/1254713697/alternate-realities-conspiracy-theories-bet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Embedded: Alternate Realities&lt;/a&gt; Reporter Zach Mack thinks his dad has gone all in on conspiracy theories, while his father thinks that Zach is the one being brainwashed. This is a really insightful and often painful look at what happens when family members start to live in an alternative reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shows.acast.com/sweet-bobby/episodes/lucky-boy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lucky Boy&lt;/a&gt; - Finished off this series about the sexual abuse of a boy by a female teacher. It was interesting to hear the double standard applied to these kinds of actions, but the similarities that sexual abuse has regardless of who it&#39;s done by and to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <summary>In the depths of COVID we turned to technology to connect us and express ourselves. Then to entertain us through the lockdowns. Then to distract us from our disrupted lives. Then we succumbed to the addiction. I think the addiction broke us and turned us into ... (looks around) ... this.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read a couple of posts this week that really got into my head. The first was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-state-of-the-culture-2024&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The State of the Culture, 2024&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a bit of a ride through ideas about Art and Entertainment and the trend for growing entertainment to eat art. It then zooms out and all of a sudden, Distraction is there to eat Entertainment. As a society, we&#39;re no longer seeking to be entertained; we&#39;re here to be distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fastest growing sector of the culture economy is &lt;em&gt;distraction&lt;/em&gt;. Or call it scrolling or swiping or wasting time or whatever you want. But it’s not art or entertainment, just ceaseless activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, X, Bluesky - and Mastodon and the fediverse too. They&#39;re all built not on engagement, connection, conversation or discussion but on distraction via little hits of dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cdb45a9-8f95-4c21-aa9e-1a830b073594_1498x1298.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Dopaming Loop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what follows behind Distraction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/65bd6a82-799e-40a4-9885-b3260cbe7d26_1730x782.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a little stunned when I saw this because it seemed so obvious. It also hit me as I&#39;d been here before. As a smoker, I&#39;d got to the same point - where you do things for Fun, Habit, Distraction and then you&#39;re staring at Addiction. It sneaks up over time until you hit that realisation that you are just ... &lt;em&gt;addicted&lt;/em&gt;. The only reason you do this thing is because of the addiction, not because it was dangerous or fun, or because it felt good in the morning with a coffee, or because it helped distract you from stress and step outside – now you&#39;re just addicted. You do it to feed the addiction, the what seems inescapable draw to just do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until you reach a point where you just can&#39;t do it anymore. Until you stop. I got to that point because what smoking was at one point had been greatly diminished. It wasn&#39;t like it was, it was shallow and mechanical. And Gioia shows that too... where the dopamine culture has got us, with a massively diminished life experiences across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b2b5af62-fecc-4cc5-8e0e-d43e034317a7_1924x1104.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Rise of Dopamine Culture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found with smoking was that there was no pleasure anymore. There was no buzz, and so the next part resonated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more addicts rely on these stimuli, the less pleasure they receive. At a certain point, this cycle creates &lt;em&gt;anhedonia&lt;/em&gt;—the complete absence of enjoyment in an experience supposedly pursued for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I feel I am right now. I wrote before of feeling stuck, but maybe that was just a symptom of the addiction, that what used to be good and fun and engaging more deeply just isn&#39;t anymore. That social media has become so hollowed out that it&#39;s now devoid of pleasure. It&#39;s not there now, and maybe it never really was. Or it was, but the whole point wasn&#39;t to engage you with art or even entertainment but to distract and addict you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article ends with a reference to Dr. Anna Lembke, author of &lt;em&gt;Dopamine Nation&lt;/em&gt;, and her suggestion of detoxing. And this is where I feel that pang of recognition. That idea of really truly disengaging makes me deeply uncomfortable. Like when I knew I was truly addicted to the cigarettes because I couldn&#39;t stop. Well, not that I couldn&#39;t, but that I &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to. There was a point after I acknowledged the addiction that I knew I had to quit. And I&#39;m realising that&#39;s where I am with all of this other &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But this &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; is ... well ...  everything!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the fuck did we break everything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I think it was Covid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve felt the aftereffects of COVID-19 on my own life. Moving 1000+ kilometers away from your family and everyone you know right before being sealed off by a global pandemic leaves a few scars. Given its size and scale, it seems logical that everyone else also experienced some of the same effects to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.md/qD2lE#selection-739.0-739.24&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;paywalled&lt;/a&gt; piece from David Wallace-Wells &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/04/opinion/covid-impact-five-years-later.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;How Covid Remade America&lt;/a&gt; talks about the long-term effects Covid had on a nation and how they are playing out now in the US. While Trump 2.0 is one thing, the fact of the matter is that when the lockdowns came, technology was there. At first, it was to express ourselves. Then, to entertain us. Then, to distract us. And then Covid went away, but the habit didn&#39;t. It stayed, and the more we sort pleasure from it, the less we got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, things aren&#39;t what they used to be, but maybe part of that is that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are not who we used to be&lt;/strong&gt;. We&#39;re addicts now. Willing to walk past the acts of bastardry we saw as long as it didn&#39;t affect us to the point where we were able to do the worst possible things to each other just so we can get another hit. Craving that stimulus, wherever it might come from. Willing to lower our standards and take whatever we can get because &lt;strong&gt;we need it now&lt;/strong&gt;. Feeding the strategy of flooding the zone and responding to everything going on around us because... we&#39;re absolutely fucking addicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s how it all broke. That&#39;s why we live here now, in all this hate and fear. We&#39;re no longer connected to reality, just to the screens, dopamine, habits, and scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where we stop, that&#39;s when we can start again. By disconnecting from the habit and giving up on our addictions. You can feel that collectively now, a realisation of what we&#39;ve left behind and turned our backs on. We need to return to place and people, to actual conversations, to talking with each other, and to sharing places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I stop, that&#39;s when I can start again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Ok the year has really kicked in as we settled back into the school and work routine.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February was the official return to the grind. School was back into swing and work kicked back in as if nothing had changed. The weather was hot this year. We had a few scorchers, with a high of 43º on one day, and still no rain. Our garden looks far from healthy, but at the same time we&#39;re not active in it. I&#39;ve used my last couple of Rostered Days Off &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/03-03-february-2025/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to start working on a new venture. At the moment we are definitely in side hustle territory, but I have now done a massive chunk of proper business plan and quite a bit of financial details to make it feel more real than before. I&#39;m keen to share more about it in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, I&#39;m still working on pumping out curriculum for the new University. My role is to work with academics as a bit of critical friend to aid them in developing a constructively aligned course, but more than anything, to move the curriculum from tacit that exists within the heads of a few individuals, and make it explicit and shared as part of the new university. Others probably don&#39;t see it like that, but it helps me sleep at night and not feel like I have become the Master of Forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that work I&#39;ve been helping develop one of the six foundational common core courses for the new Adelaide University. These courses form a set of mandatory electives in the new programs, with students needing to complete one of the six courses in each year of their study (3 of the 6). I&#39;m working on one in the domain of entrepreneurship and design thinking, while there are others in Artificial Intelligence, Indigenous Knowledges, Data Science, Ethics and Cultural Competencies. This has been quite a fun project to work on. Essentially, they are going to be massive courses (potentially 2000 enrolled) and are being sold as transformative learning opportunities. Developing an open curriculum for these courses where any student from any program at any year level can participate is a brand new challenge, and designing a conventional curriculum is challenging – and that&#39;s what I love. The Challenge! I really wish more of my work was like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started to working on the new Adelaide University Online section. It seems a bit late, but we are going back to first principles – literally developing the principles for what this whole area should and could look like now and into the future. It&#39;s been great to unpack the past and look forward to ways that we can do this into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was definitely a stay-at-home kind of month, with just a few outings. We are trialling out a new family in preparation of a significant change to our home loan payments. We were smart enough to lock in out interest rate when we got the loan, but there is a time limit on that rate and it&#39;s about to hit. So it&#39;s time to put some constraints on our spending and keep better track of what we spend it on. A lot of it has been tightening up on outgoings and cancelling subscriptions, but the reality it inflation is just smashing us and everyone with just the standard food/shelter deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did venture out of a colleagues birthday, had friends around for dinner&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/03-03-february-2025/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, had an overnight test drive with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cupraofficial.com.au/cars/cupra-range/born&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cupra Born&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/03-03-february-2025/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, went to an Asian Food Market in the city and got out on the bike. Still feeling I need to kickstart some change, but also trying to be more content with just being where we are and taking some time out to rest and relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best snaps of the month&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/timklapdor/albums/72177720323546892&quot; title=&quot;2025&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54361560351_3377abf4ac_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; alt=&quot;2025&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watched&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a family movie night and watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12584954/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Twisters&lt;/a&gt; which functions perfectly as a stupid family movie. I enjoyed&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14044212/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; Mr. &amp;amp; Mrs. Smith&lt;/a&gt; TV series, which mixed enough intrigue into the action and relatively minor character development. There were some nice gags along the way and interesting easter eggs in the story. Rewatched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429493/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The A-Team&lt;/a&gt; with Ms. 13, and am glad we found something we both enjoyed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://super.rugby/superrugby/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Super Rugby&lt;/a&gt; has started again for the year, so that&#39;s been great to watch. I also finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27444205/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;, another post-apocalyptic bunker TV show. Not sure why that would be in the Zeitgeist at all but follows Silo and Fallout. This one is set in a billionaire&#39;s Bunker that’s been “designed” to create paradise on earth - by replicating suburbia, driving cars and an odd nostalgia for the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinlane.com/2025/02/22/how-our-hearts-got-tangled-up-with-this-rottweiler/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this post from Kin Lane&lt;/a&gt; about their dog and how they became such a part of their life&#39;s journey. Last year, I had to return from our family holiday after the first night as Frankie had to go to the emergency vet, and how that pang of responsibility hits deep and hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-02-23-dale/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;What Felt Impossible Became Possible&lt;/a&gt; - A bit of a story about George Dale, who campaigned in the 1920s against the Ku Klux Klan. This is a bit of a call to arms against Fascism and a reminder — &lt;strong&gt;Fascism always fails&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Listened&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://podfollow.com/the-rest-is-classified/view&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Rest is Classified&lt;/a&gt; after several recommendations on Mastodon and enjoying the stories so far. I also went back and listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/bag-man/id1438463967&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bag Man from Rachel Maddow&lt;/a&gt; about Spiro Agnew, who I only knew as a headless body in Futurama. Another great historical series, and again, it confirms that it&#39;s all just history repeating!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AI Idealism</title>

    <updated>2025-02-18T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <media:content 
        xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" 
        url="https://heartsoulmachine.com/assets/social-previews/ai-idealism-preview.jpeg"

    <summary>What are the ideals of AI? What is the vision we are being asked to buy into?</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m really curious about framing the critique of technology through the Idealist vs Materialist lens, as per &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/02-11-catching-up-with-critique/&quot;&gt;Jathan Sadowski&lt;/a&gt;. So after listening to another raft of news about AI valuations, I was trying to think about the Idealism of AI – and I’m wondering if they forgot to do the homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early Internet formed around the idea of being the frontier - this new digital world, a chance to reimagine and reinvent everything. Social Media had the idea of connectedness – of sharing, inclusion and global togetherness. While neither lived up to these ideals, there was at least something to graft the hype onto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With AI, what is the Ideal? I can’t spot it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every proposed ideal future feels like a dystopia. Then there are the apocalyptic overtones and alternatives that AI prophets dole out in equal measure. The result is a complete lack of Idealism to drive the hype machine or connect with people’s consciousness (or sub or un consciousness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing in the AI futures that inspires, except for the fantasy of some congress of human and machine&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/02-18-ai-idealism/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Behind every proposed rosy future has an equivalent Black Mirror where it all goes horribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you hear from AI prophets is an ideal world free from labour and effort, where AI and robots are capable of doing everything. Where all endeavour has become so commoditised, we need to rethink society. It’s also a world where human effort is worthless, and we are unmoored from our place in society and the world. It is a neocolonial state where we the people, become enslaved by the robot masters, that elite sphere of men that control the machines from their underground bunkers. And that’s the ideal?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big sell is that you have no place in the world anymore, that anything that provides you with the slightest piece of worth or value is worthless and easily replaced by the ever-creeping colonial power. You write to make meaning? AI can do that. You draw and create images? AI can do that. It&#39;s that world, or the apocalypse. One where the world is destroyed by some paper clip replicating AI, or one that takes control of nuclear missiles and destroys us all because someone misprogrammed the concept of peace and balance in the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal of AI is not the one of the early Internet out on the frontier, where you can explore some great expanse. No AI has explored for you and deemed you unworthy. AI does not connect you with world, it provides summaries of it so you don&#39;t have to engage and stay isolated and unquestioning. The AI ideal is not one where the person or their experience is valued – it&#39;s one where you have no value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the Materialist critique - what can the AI do? Well, so far, it can do parlour tricks. It’s a modern day Mechanical Turk&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/02-18-ai-idealism/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; where, in very specific circumstances, it can generate text (that&#39;s closely based on the training data that it ingested) and provide passable responses to a flawed evaluation system. What it’s able to do is trick us into believing that there is an inherent “ability”, as opposed to a statistically &amp;quot;more probable guess&amp;quot;. They have fooled us into believing that intelligence is the ability to respond to a prompt correctly&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/02-18-ai-idealism/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is somehow an equivalent to intelligent behaviour. The only materialist perspective that AI is successful is its ability to delude and fool people into assuming this is anything more than fancy If-This-Then-That programming. That the “chat” window is anything more than fancier command line prompt. That somehow this “industry” is worth hundreds of billions of dollars of investment and expenditure, while the planet fucking burns. That’s the material success of AI – is to somehow want us to accept and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;invest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;(!) in this new colonial project where the most likely outcome is financial ruin and environmental collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, I get this interest in AI. There are some cool things it enables people to do. Personally, I don’t engage in the kinds of tasks that it’s good at or where outsourcing this kind of labour benefits me. I’ve used AI, and on a few occasions, I’ve benefited from the textual analysis that LLMs are very proficient at doing. Is it Intelligent? No, it’s an app, like the dozen or so I interact with daily, except I have no daily requirement to use it. I don’t find the generative functions helpful or useful - but that’s because I use words to communicate thoughts, and choosing them is part of the cognitive process of thought - not an abstraction away from the thought itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve found the language tools that LLMs provide useful, helping to translate and transpose language. I&#39;ve seen some fantastic experiments using AI to write code, which is great because, among other things, we lack the language skills to effectively use these big &#39;ol digital machines and make them do what we want. But none of this is intelligence—it&#39;s programming. It&#39;s prompt engineering, which is what most of modern computing is anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What exactly do you see when you run it past the idealist and materialist lens? I see ... just another app. I think this is what AI looks like when the sheen rubs off.  It&#39;s just another technology that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be helpful, if we just used it in how it for what it was developed for and what it can functionally can do. Let&#39;s not oversell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is quite literally the fantasy of having sex with robots so that the transaction can be free of guilt,  emotion and commitment &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/02-18-ai-idealism/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, not the colonialist and non-ironic low paid labour hire service where you pay third world workers a barely subsistence wage to be the “smarts” behind every application and service that has &amp;quot;Smart&amp;quot; baked in. I mean the o.g. man-pretending-to-be-a-robot trick. &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/02-18-ai-idealism/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the more defined the prompt the “better” it’s able to respond, I mean come on! It&#39;s on easy mode and your activating cheat codes at this point. An intelligence would be able, and does, &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/02-18-ai-idealism/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Highlighting some excellent conversations and critiques that are floating out there on the #SmallWeb</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We seem to be returning to a cycle of excellent critique about the current wave of tech. As always, Paris Marx is knocking it out of the park with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techwontsave.us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tech Won’t Save Us&lt;/a&gt; podcast - and I’ve really enjoyed the new weekly chat with Brian Merchant over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2425400.rss&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;System Crash&lt;/a&gt;. This week was sans-Paris, but had Cory Doctrow on as a guest host for the week. This was such a good conversation about the week that was and I do really appreciate Cory’s perspective on things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also started to listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/thismachinekillspod&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;This Machine Kills&lt;/a&gt; with Jathan Sadowski and Edward Ongweso Jr.. I came across Jathan&#39;s work recently on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techwontsave.us/episode/259_how_to_see_tech_like_a_luddite_w_jathan_sadowski/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tech Won&#39;t Save Us episode&lt;/a&gt; and Ed&#39;s appearances on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.betteroffline.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Better Offline&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s coverage of CES. I love their dialogic style, which again isn&#39;t necessarily conversational, but more rap battle or consecutive monologues where they riff off each other and spin their own story. If you&#39;re up for something with a bit more passion and swearing, Ed Zitron has found his voice in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://linktr.ee/betteroffline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Better Offline&lt;/a&gt; podcast and newsletter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wheresyoured.at/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Where&#39;s Your Ed At&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found that Helen Beetham has been recording a podcast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://helenbeetham.substack.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Imperfect Offerings&lt;/a&gt; and has two chats with indomitable Audrey Watters. I’ve missed Audrey’s critical voice on tech, but I&#39;ve always understood her motivation and need to escape it and spend her energy elsewhere. I haven’t been able to get into her &lt;a href=&quot;https://2ndbreakfast.audreywatters.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Second Breakfast&lt;/a&gt; and it&#39;s original focus on fitness and fit-tech (but loved hearing her experience of running and feeling good). There is a real return to form in these two episodes - and uneasy recognition of her tagline of the Casandra of Ed Tech (it was all true and more people should have listened!). The dialogue between Audrey and Helen is more in the style of intellectual dialogue, as opposed a straight-up conversation, but there is a warmth and respect between the two that&#39;s refreshing as it&#39;s not adversarial. There is more rigorous agreement, but they bring together two different perspectives and experiences together to explore with depth and care our current situation. There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://helenbeetham.substack.com/p/the-audrey-watters-episode&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Audrey Watters episode&lt;/a&gt; which is then followed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://helenbeetham.substack.com/p/second-breakfast-x-imperfect-offering&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Second Breakfast x Imperfect Offering #2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping on the Audrey theme, I also watched her &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.reclaim.tv/videos/watch/00ac4035-ab52-4960-a4a5-1eaf9d7cbe4a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;chat with Jim Groom on blogging and writing&lt;/a&gt; - and it was a fantastic way to start the week. Hearing her journey into writing, finding and reinventing yourself was really inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Focus vs Distraction</title>

    <summary>Trying to make sense of how I feel in a world that is being shaped by a strategy of distraction.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In January 2024, I started working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/focus-course/&quot;&gt;Focus Course&lt;/a&gt;. Part of that program involved developing your goals and ways of achieving them. The program gave me a good sense of where I wanted to go in the longer term, but I&#39;ve struggled with how to actually do what I need to do. I still need to improve my focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While part of being focused is having goals to provide direction, focus requires you not to be distracted. Distraction is something that&#39;s weighing on me at the moment. Over the last two decades, I&#39;ve witnessed the world that we live in become one giant distraction machine. Through the proliferation of social media into every daily moment and the atomisation of news, it&#39;s challenging to see and find what&#39;s important these days and what to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filtering to stay focused or even turn off the firehose of distraction isn&#39;t as easy as it should be. Work, life, and family all synced with modern technology and life so they are intertwined and tangled in messy ways. Our reality is that life is just dealing with distractions at almost every level – family, house, car, pets, job, school,  social commitments, and community. All of these things have a required level of attention which, as a whole, feel just like one distraction after another. With each distraction, it&#39;s so hard to see what to do next and this compounds with interest each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last week, I&#39;ve also noticed that distraction is an actual tactic and a strategy inflicted being used on us. Trump and Elon have just released an absolute barrage of shitfuckery (my new favourite term from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thejuicemedia.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Juice Media&lt;/a&gt;). The fact Trump comes in with 200 executive orders on day one, each one worse and more heinous than the last, is tactical. Each of these orders impacts countless lives and the functions of families, peoples, and individuals who are being attacked in very direct ways - and there is no way to address every single one. And when we try and focus on one, we are distracted by the other 199 potential attrocities. And then along comes King Twit, who&#39;s out there parading Nazi salutes and sieg-heiling around publicly, which just adds to the distraction. And then when he denies it, we get distracted again, but you can see that it&#39;s all just a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find all this just incredibly disappointing. This is where we live now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the milieu. This is the environment we are in. This is the river that we&#39;re swimming in, full of sludge and shit. I think we just need to acknowledge that this isn&#39;t just a coincidence that we&#39;ve ended up here. This is a specific strategy. This is the outcome of specific actions people have taken. There are people who think this stuff up and engage to make it happen. It is their job, their &lt;em&gt;career&lt;/em&gt;, to put us in this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing distraction as a tactic has made me more attentive. Now, as I look at what&#39;s happening, it feels like I&#39;m living in an Adam Curtis documentary. I can imagine the 80s graphic overlays and stock footage almost as I walk through town and hear whatever next travesty is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim is for us to be so caught up in our distractions that we feel paralyzed, unable to act, move, or unite. Finding focus requires us to reduce distractions and reduce the noise. To find quiet. To find some peace. To unplug.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Thirty-one days into the year. How&#39;s it all going?</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote about my &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-27-the-january-slump/&quot;&gt;January slump&lt;/a&gt;, but in general, I feel OK. I feel like I can see the big picture but am lacking focus and details. I attempted to do a bit of life planning while off during the first week – but to be honest I feel like I am spreading myself too thin. I want to go back and plot more things on a timeline of the year to try and have &#39;focus&#39; seasons, and be a bit more realistic with my time and what I am capable of doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girls had their birthdays. Ms A is now thirteen, which means I have become the parent of a teenager. So far, it&#39;s been pretty positive; she&#39;s taking a lot more responsibility for herself, has put her hand up to do things around the house, and we had a proper, unprompted conversation about school after her first day at the new school. The new school is a big change for the year. She didn&#39;t have a great experience at the closest school to us - so the change is a chance at a new start and it seems to be positive so far. Mrs K took Ms A up to Sydney for her birthday to see her family up that way, and I got to hang with Frankie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mum visited for Ms A&#39;s birthday and the sleepover party - so we survived that and the next day, went for a morning swim and had a chance encounter with a dolphin who swam by almost within arm&#39;s distance! Ms A and I went go-carting which was good fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went and checked out the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.botanicgardens.sa.gov.au/chihuly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; Chihuly in the Botanic Garden&lt;/a&gt; exhibition which was cool - although the highlight for me was watching the little family of &lt;a href=&quot;https://birdlife.org.au/bird-profiles/australasian-grebe/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;grebes&lt;/a&gt; that had made their home of a floating nest near one of the artworks. (Also - I love the animal identification system built into iOS that helped with finding out what kind of birds they are!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rounded out the last week of month with very hot and dry week. Monday there was a high fire danger day, and after picking the girls up from the airport, there were a lot of sirens and aircraft near us. The SA Alert app warned of a fire in Panorama and that we were to wait for advice. As a precaution, we packed up an emergency bag and waited to see what happened. Fortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1A5oca5F5Y/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the fire was under control within the hour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then had to deal with the opposite problem - a flood in the laundry! Fortunately, the plumber advised contacting SA Water as we have an easement on the property. they came out pretty quickly, checked the problem and cleared out the blockage (which was on out end but he helped out and worked on it for us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note - as an event I&#39;ve also signed up for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/tags/blogging4life&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;#blogging4life&lt;/a&gt; happening that&#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/timklapdor/albums/72177720323546892&quot; title=&quot;2025&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54301222128_c8fa31e9bd_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; alt=&quot;2025&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watched&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got through a few movies and some TV during January:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt30319854/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sugarcane&lt;/a&gt; - powerful and moving documentary about the aftermath of residential schools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt5144174/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Dry&lt;/a&gt; - pretty standard mystery, but kind of enjoyed Eric Bana being on screen again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt7713068/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Birds of Prey&lt;/a&gt; - Margot Robbie&#39;s duality of Harlequin and Barbie is great. Watched with Ms A.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt6334354/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/a&gt; - I enjoyed how stupid and fun this movie is. I love the genre pisstake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt31122777/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Say Nothing&lt;/a&gt; - great show about the Price sisters in Northern Ireland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt24053860/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Day of the Jackal&lt;/a&gt; - I really liked this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Listened&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of highlights from the month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techwontsave.us/episode/259_how_to_see_tech_like_a_luddite_w_jathan_sadowski&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;How to See Tech Like a Luddite&lt;/a&gt; episode of Tech Won&#39;t Save us with Jathan Sadowski was so enlightening that I even wrote a post about it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-31-the-luddite-and-the-mechanic/&quot;&gt;The Luddite &amp;amp; the Mechanic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This extended run about this vital refugee corridor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+AA4cUOfDx48&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Darien Gap&lt;/a&gt;, was very new to me. The reporting is excellent and engaging, but the stories told are heartbreaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to take a bit more effort to record my reading diet at the moment. Some standout pieces though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kinlane.com/2025/01/14/digital-fracking/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Digital Fracking&lt;/a&gt; - Kin does a great job introducing fracking as a metaphor for what is happening across our digital platforms at the moment. I think there is real resonance between the two, especially the unintended and negative consequences - like [lighting your water on fire](&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/4LBjSXWQRV8&quot; title=&quot;Share link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/4LBjSXWQRV8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mertbulan.com/2025/01/26/once-you-are-laid-off-you-will-never-be-the-same-again/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Once You&#39;re Laid Off, You&#39;ll Never Be the Same Again&lt;/a&gt; - some thoughts on work. The poignant bit here is the heading &amp;quot;You’re Just a Row in an Excel Table&amp;quot; - which is such an important reminder of how a version of you is seen at the organisational level. It might also be worth noting that you may not even get the dignity of a row and are more likely a division of a single cell. 😢&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <summary>Looking at tech criticism and critique through the lens of the Luddite and the Mechanic.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techwontsave.us/episode/259_how_to_see_tech_like_a_luddite_w_jathan_sadowski&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tech Won&#39;t Save Us&lt;/a&gt; podcast episode with Jathan Sadowski discussing his new book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucpress.edu/books/the-mechanic-and-the-luddite/paper&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Mechanic and the Luddite - A Ruthless Criticism of Technology and Capitalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. In the podcast, Jathan introduces a few concepts that I found interesting and engaging, even if it was first thing in the morning when I listened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one was around the &lt;strong&gt;Idealist versus Materialist&lt;/strong&gt; forms of analysis and critique. The way it was explained in the podcast, and the way I interpreted it, was the idealistic analysis is like trying to &lt;em&gt;fight fire with fire&lt;/em&gt;. In the sense that a lot happening in tech is driven by just hype and ideal future states. They are trying to sell the possible and idealistic because there isn&#39;t a material object or real thing to latch on to - just possibilities and potential. So an idealistic critique attacks those same possibilities, proposing alternative ideals and futures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a Materialistic analysis is thinking about how it works, why it works, and what is tangible – like where is the money coming from? Who do the people involved work for? What does the technology actually do (not what do you think it&#39;s going to do in the future)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t really thought about critique in this way and that different types of critique and analysis were possible. It prompted some thoughts on the kinds of analysis that I and others in edtech have done and why some critiques resonate with a large audience, and some fall flat. I’m also thinking at some of the more spiteful critiques and critics out there and what kinds of analysis they’re actually engaged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central idea of Jathan&#39;s book is the Mechanic and the Luddite. I really liked their use of these perspectives in framing critiques and perspectives of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mechanic&#39;s perspective is involved in the technical aspects of things. Thinking about and knowing how technology works underpins their approach. Here, the focus is on whether and how the technology works (or doesn&#39;t). The critique is more on the nuts and bolts, technical machinery, and approaches embedded in the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Luddite&#39;s focus is on technology&#39;s social and community impacts, thinking about how it affects, changes and shapes society. The Luddite critique wasn&#39;t against technology per se but against its impact on people, their welfare and livelihoods and the downstream effects on their communities. Their concerns arose from losing good jobs, good work, and work-from-home privileges – which were hallmarks not just of today&#39;s struggles but at the time of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those books I&#39;d like to read through and get into these ideas a bit more. Some books cover the essentials in the podcast, but this one seems to go deeper than the introduction to the ideas in the podcast. I hadn&#39;t encountered Jathan before, and I liked how he discussed the the idealistic and materialistic analysis side of things. I looked him up and found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/thismachinekillspod&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;This Machine Kills podcast&lt;/a&gt; which he does with Edward Ongweso Jr., who I also found great to listen to on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linktr.ee/betteroffline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Better Offline&lt;/a&gt; podcast&#39;s coverage of CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I came away with was the ability to contextualise critique with a bit more nuance. It&#39;s interesting to think about the work of critics I like, say, the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://audreywatters.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Audrey Watters&lt;/a&gt;, who I&#39;ve always loved but can be polarising (although I&#39;ve never understood why).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intellectual Outsourcing</title>

    <summary>One of the things that I fear within the AI hype and the desire to inject it into all aspects of life is that it&#39;s a process of outsourcing.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been trying to connect a few thoughts together to get to this point. I put together a note on what I feel about &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/outsourcing/&quot;&gt;outsourcing&lt;/a&gt;, which frames my thinking about it as a more general concept, and in doing so, I dug up an old post in which I discussed &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-29-outsource-and-centralise/&quot;&gt;outsourcing and centralising&lt;/a&gt; as typical features organisations use to find &amp;quot;efficiency&amp;quot;. In that same way, I&#39;ve started to see AI implementation as a form and extension of outsourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel it’s important to note that the current generation of AI tools available are &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; “intelligence” but language analysis tools. They are sophisticated and in many ways masquerade as lifelike&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-30-intellectual-outsourcing/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Still, they are not intelligent beyond language analysis. They are not fact machines. They don’t understand concepts or meaning beyond statistical analysis and probability. They are derivative machines, highly capable of simulating thought only because we’ve associated output and product with thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans have developed language as a way to communicate thoughts. Language is a way we can share life&#39;s intangible aspects alongside various artistic endeavours - from painting to music to dance. The words aren’t the thinking or emotions themselves, they are descriptions of what we experience - attachments and appendages to our lived reality. They express meaning, but the meaning itself is something else, not the language or the words - the meaning is the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I listen to the latest murmurings about “AI’s” applications, I keep hearing exclamations that have confused the ability to produce language with the ability to think. They are not the same. An ability to recite numbers not correspond with an ability to complete mathematical tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media have unquestionably fed the hype that AI will be a replacements for people, jobs and entire industries. Yet when we look at what abilities AI currently has its scope and success only goes as far as to demonstrate their statistical ability to generate words correctly to a predefined set of parameters. Sure the accuracy of the words and language chosen is significantly better than previous iterations, but AI isn’t developing the prompt. It’s not creating the parameters or assessing the output or correcting its mistakes. It’s not thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a job fits those parameters (generate words correctly to a predefined set of parameters), then yes, AI will likely replace it. But if that is the job, the. It probably falls into what David Graeber calls &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs?wprov=sfti1#&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bullshit Jobs&lt;/a&gt; and may actually be of social benefit (or, better an understanding, these jobs are superfluous to society and a waste of resources). Beyond that though - what is it the AI will disrupt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I fear is the other “sell” – that these tools will allow us to outsource thinking&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-30-intellectual-outsourcing/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just imagine a world where you don’t have to think!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; To some, that is the goal - to outsource thinking completely. The bluff, though, is that they can’t. They can generate words, but there’s a big conflation between that and crafting a story, developing a solution or exploring a dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my job, we have been presented with an AI tool to “help” with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_alignment?wprov=sfti1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;constructive alignment&lt;/a&gt; in courses. The idea is that you feed it learning outcomes, and then it provides you with a grading rubric for the course. The actual results are less than perfect and are mostly unsuitable and unusable because they are filled with errors, misconceptions and conflations. By engaging with the tool, the thinking required to do constructive alignment has been outsourced. The output of a grading rubric is usually the result of thinking about aligning skills, knowledge and activities with evidence of learning, the process of analysis and reflection, consideration of the course as a whole and pulling together expert knowledge and teaching experience. When you hand the production of the artefact to the AI, you have circumvented the thought that goes into the artefact. The content that the AI spits out is &lt;em&gt;thoughtless&lt;/em&gt; and usually &lt;em&gt;thoughtless slop&lt;/em&gt;, as the prediction of language is not a substitute for the thinking required to properly do constructive alignment. What I’ve found to be helpful in this situation is to avoid the tool altogether and to guide the thinking of alignment through a stepped process. By doing this instead, we have words that are considered and meaningful rather than probable. The rubric is thoughtful, ensuring that it accurately reflects the intentions and expectations of the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bit of coincidence, Miguel Guhlin posted a link to an interesting study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;AI Tools in Society: Impacts on Cognitive Offloading and the Future of Critical Thinking&lt;/a&gt;. It concludes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our research demonstrates a significant negative correlation between the frequent use of AI tools and critical thinking abilities, mediated by the phenomenon of cognitive offloading. This suggests that while AI tools offer undeniable benefits in terms of efficiency and accessibility, they may inadvertently diminish users’ engagement in deep, reflective thinking processes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feelings align with this research, but I&#39;d take it further. The only benefits of efficiency and accessibility are in text analysis and generation. If that is not the aim or purpose of the task, then there is no benefit, especially if it is an attempt to outsource or offload thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Outsource &amp; Centralise</title>

    <summary>The desire to outsource and centralise in organisations tends to do more harm and cost more when it comes to knowledge work.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote the bulk of this post almost a decade ago as the university I was working at was undergoing a formal review by a consulting firm to propose a restructure aimed at improving “efficiency”. Given that I am in that situation again (the university I am currently working at is merging with another university) and the same consulting firm is managing the process - I thought I’d publish an update. Firstly, to argue about their two pillars, which I predict will form part of their key recommendations for the organisational structure. The other is to make a point that we still don&#39;t understand or appreciate knowledge work as being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The playbook for most consulting firms is pretty limited, and most advice they essentially boils down to two things - outsource and centralise. Why? Because it&#39;s worked in the past. There are great exemplars of business transformation being achieved through these types of measures. I&#39;m not going to debate that, but what I would suggest is that those examples only occurred when dealing with issues of &lt;em&gt;labour&lt;/em&gt; - not knowledge. A business based on manual labour can reduce costs through outsourcing to a cheaper labour market, and centralisation can produce savings at scale. However, labour is a simplified concept that has little to do with many businesses today, especially in my case - a university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we require &amp;quot;labour&amp;quot; to function, but that term doesn&#39;t reflect what most people within the organisation do. What they do is deal with is people and information. To do this requires &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt;, and understanding requires the development of &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;. So the work our people do looks less like traditional manual labour and more like knowledge work&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-29-outsource-and-centralise/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that distinction in mind, let’s look at the concepts of outsourcing and centralisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we Outsourcing knowledge, we lose on many fronts. We lose access to the people who possess it, and we lose it as an organisational asset. We also add a cost to the business. To access outsourced knowledge, we now have to pay for it; the &amp;quot;vendor&amp;quot; of that knowledge knows that and will ensure we pay for it – forever. We also lose the ability for that knowledge to grow, adapt and change. This is a key difference between knowledge and labour - labour has a static value&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-29-outsource-and-centralise/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but knowledge can grow and decline. Knowledge can develop and change organically, but labour can&#39;t. So &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/outsourcing/&quot;&gt;outsourcing&lt;/a&gt; treats knowledge as static, robbing it of its very essence so that it can fit nicely on someone&#39;s spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centralisation also suffers the same fate because it treats knowledge as a static value. The thinking that centralising knowledge into specific units fails to comprehend that knowledge is how we deal with complexity. To deal with complexity, we have to experience it, and through that experience, we learn. Learning is the basis of growing knowledge, not sticking it in a vacuum. Centralisation stifles knowledge creation as it starves it of the nutrients that diversity brings. The differences we encounter is key for learning because it is fundamentally about challenging, changing and reforming models and patterns of thinking. Centralisation, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Taleb&lt;/a&gt; might put it, ensures an organisation becomes fragile. It robs it of the ability to grow knowledge, which eventually makes the organisation dumber and less able to adapt to a changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, despite what the spreadsheets might say, outsourcing and centralisation significantly harm the organisation as a whole. It adds a cost rather than removes one, ensuring the organisation is less agile and adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The January Slump</title>

    <summary>Coming into the last throes of January, a lot of that New Year&#39;s enthusiasm has been zapped from my psyche. A couple of weeks back at work will do that to you.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I find January such a rollercoaster month of emotions. The first week is usually spent with family and having a well-needed rest to get over the year that was. At the same time, there&#39;s the bulk of 365 days in front of you and a certain level of enthusiasm for making change, taking a fresh start, and getting things done. But once you head back to work and the routine kicks in, you realise, &amp;quot;Hey, this job takes up a lot of time and effort, and I don&#39;t feel there&#39;s much left over for everything I wanted to do&amp;quot;. It starts to weigh you down, even though the sun is shining&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-27-the-january-slump/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the weather is probably too hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this time of year is a real motivation slump for me. I really like reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-27-the-january-slump/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Doug Belshaw&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s ways of working and how, over the years, he has become more seasonally attuned. I&#39;ve never thought about it or given it much time and scope, but it&#39;s crept into my mind over the last year. I can recognise this slump, the same as the one in winter when we don&#39;t have a break and go somewhere warm. It feels odd though, having this feeling in the middle of summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember Alain de Botton discussing the idea of having time in the calendar for festivals and events and rituals&#39; role in grounding us. This was in relation to what we can learn and borrow from religion in a more secular society. Ritual is one thing that I&#39;ve spent most of my life avoiding. The rituals of religion were probably the first to drop off, and once the forced timetable of school-based ritual was finished, so was I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I guess I&#39;ve just been freestyling, not having any actual rituals, any real structure, just bobbing along, moving from thing to thing. But to be honest, I&#39;m starting to crave structure a bit more, at least wanting to feel more connected to things and having those common rituals and events seem logical for that to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people have work rituals, such as a regular conference that they go to every year. That&#39;s been hugely challenging in my role as a professional staff member of a university, as we&#39;re not given the same structural perks or opportunities. Funding isn&#39;t made available on a recurring basis; it&#39;s potluck depending on how the budget looks that year. We tend to have a pool of funds available to a group of staff, so it&#39;s unfair to expect that you get the same allocation every single year moving forward while others don&#39;t get an opportunity to do any development. At the moment, work is so ad-hoc and unpredictable it&#39;s impossible to build any structure or routine there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m starting to think that with this lack of motivation starting to kick in – I need to do something. I guess January is the only time of year I tend to come to a complete stop. It&#39;s perhaps starting the engine again that is the challenge. Stopping is important. It has meaning in itself. That ability to switch off, that ability to sit around and watch the cricket for a day, is really important, not just from the mental side of things but from the physical too. That&#39;s probably where I&#39;m feeling it the most, not having that same motivation to head to the gym or head out for a hike – especially in the heat. This, in turn, impacts my mental health, and then the slump kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to get out requires a kickstart to push past that initial resistance and inertia There&#39;s a clip that appears on Reddit fairly often about starting a tractor with a shotgun, and I&#39;m wondering if that is what I need, some short, sharp explosion to get things up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/eBLlVUc0sEU?si=gsqz7rCCVEmAx3Kc&amp;amp;t=81&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/eBLlVUc0sEU?si=gsqz7rCCVEmAx3Kc&amp;amp;t=81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy to take suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Car Shopping in 2025</title>

    <summary>It&#39;s that stage in life where we are looking at a new car. I thought I&#39;d write up something quickly about what&#39;s out there, but there&#39;s a bit more to this whole thing.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We got our family car back in 2012 - the mighty Skoda Octavia RS TDI. Going for a performance diesel was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I got a car that was incredibly fun to drive, had plenty of power, was incredibly efficient for long-distance driving, and had a boot that could take everything thrown at it. I still love the car, but it shows it&#39;s 13 years on the planet now. Just before Christmas, we gave it a very thorough service and got new tyres, but it requires a bit more work - replacing some parts in the front end, fixing the AC and a new electrical fault where the power cycles in and out randomly (which I managed to &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; by pulling out the fuse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran well with just one car, but as the demands increased with a school-aged kid, we got a runabout, a well-priced deal on VW Golf Comfortline. It&#39;s super practical, relatively comfortable and does everything well. It also has some work that needs doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When both cars started to play up, I decided we needed to have a bit more of a realistic &amp;quot;end-of-life&amp;quot; scenario in place. The plan was to keep the Skoda, given its practicality as a family car and lack of appeal in the second-hand market. While it lacks the mod-cons of carplay and electric seats, it eats the kilometres and will do most of the 1000 kms back to Wagga on a single tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve made it a habit to use our increased use of rental cars when travelling to take the opportunity to test drive other vehicles, especially EVs. So, over the last couple of years, I&#39;ve driven the Polestar 2, Kia EV6, Tesla Model Y, BMW i4, the ICE BMW X3M, Audi Q2 and Cupra Alteca. I&#39;ll include some driving notes at the end of the post&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-19-car-shopping-in-2025/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want an EV - they are simply nicer cars to drive. That said, the price of EVs has been much higher than their ICE rivals. Pricing has gotten sharper in the last year, so come 2025, an EV is on the cards. While I would love to spend the money on a Polestar 4 with all the extras or a Volvo XC40 (which we have test-driven), we don&#39;t have that kind of money. We did a test drive of the EX30 Volvo when it came out, and while I love the car and the interior, there is no way to get any one of us to sit comfortably in the back seat. It made me very sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With stiff competition from Chinese EVs coming into the market and another swathe this year, fingers crossed that all brands get pushed to compete more on price. There are a bunch of cars that are more our price range now which we haven&#39;t had a chance to see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mgmotor.com.au/models/mg-mg4/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MG4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bydautomotive.com.au/dolphin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;BYD Dolphin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bydautomotive.com.au/seal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;BYD Seal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leapmotor.net/au/c10&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Leapmotor C1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cupraofficial.com.au/cars/cupra-range/born&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cupra Born&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Saturday Drive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, the family went window shopping. The plan was to get a sense of the cars (looks, materials, feel and space), consider what mattered to each of us, and create some criteria for assessing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;MG&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started with the MG, which I had high hopes for as I had seen many of them around. There&#39;s a lot around, as their pricing is pretty sharp. That said, the MG4 did not pass the family test. Backseat comfort is key in our family given the size of our offspring, and we rotate who gets back seat duties. While we didn&#39;t test drive it - the fit and finish felt off, and there were some weird ergonomics and placement within the cabin. Noticeable issues were getting comfortable in the driving position, and despite being shown the top-of-the-line model... it all looked cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Leapmotors&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we headed to Leapmotors, a bit of a wild card but on the way to the BYD shop. The new C1 is an SUV, somewhere in the mid-size, but it is pretty big on the outside. On the inside it&#39;s impressive. This was on another level in comparison to the MG. The fit and finish were way more impressive, comfortable and almost sumptuous in comparison. My daughter was in heaven – the back seat gets limousine-like levels of space and comfort. The sales guy seemed keen to get us into the car for a drive, so we went out. Driving it felt light and nimble, slightly unnerving because a car this size and weight shouldn&#39;t be. All the systems worked, and we warned about all the driving aids (that can be turned off, but maybe not as a default). The speed limit was helpful as the car accelerated gracefully and silently. Although the car&#39;s dynamics weren&#39;t up to test, it felt pretty capable in the city and during the brief highway stint we did. I doubt this will be a &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; drive, but in terms of comfort, this was a standout. I was shocked at the end of it. I did not expect that much car and quality of finish for that price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cupra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then went for lunch and on to Cupra to inspect the Born. This is a car that&#39;s recently had a massive discount applied from around $65,000 driveaway (all fees and registration) down to $49,990 – which is how it made it on the list. This seems like a direct replacement for the Golf, it&#39;s a small hatchback, but I was surprised at the amount of space available inside. The seats are sporty, comfortable and supportive in the front and back. The new cars have an &amp;quot;interior&amp;quot; pack that removes the middle seat in the back to make it a 4 seater, which, to be honest, is honest. There is ample leg room, the kind I wish the EX30 had, and upfront, it was great too. This one is going in to be booked for a test drive as it wasn&#39;t available on the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BYD&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final stop of the day was BYD. These are the new go-to Chinese EVs, and I was surprised at the premium feel of the Dolphin and Seal inside. That said - these are the absolute opposite of the Tesla minimalist aesthetic. There are buttons everywhere and a giant rotateable screen. Fit and finish seemed good, but the cars seemed overwhelming on the inside. The sales guy informed us they had no demonstration cars - they&#39;ve cleared their entire inventory. My pick of the two would probably be the Dolphin. Given its pricing, I had pretty low expectations, but it was pretty good overall in terms of space, features and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at the end of the day, I probably ended up in a very different place than going in. I had thought the MG4 would make a strong case for itself, but we all saw significant drawbacks. The Cupra Born made a massive case for itself given its proximity in price to the MG4 model we were looking at, and having the Cupra badge, I&#39;d say that this could actually be a very fun car to drive. Initially, we were thinking about replacing the VW Golf, but the Leapmotors C1 shook that up. That&#39;s a lot of money for the car, and I can see it being a pretty sensible choice. But at the same time, given the money being spent, it might be worth thinking about going bigger and stretching the budget a bit further and replacing the Skoda. Without getting ridiculous, that could include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cupra Tavascan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kia EV5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart #3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ford Mach E&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is to look at the second-hand market, but it can be unpredictable, and it is not entirely clear how that relates to leasing options and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did come out of the day was some good discussion about what we want out of the car and some criteria to mark them against:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt; - We need to work on our budget a bit more, but essentially a score on how close to our budget the price is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rear space&lt;/strong&gt;: Can we fit in the back, literally? How does it feel in terms of height, width, and leg room?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rear comfort&lt;/strong&gt; - Is it comfortable for a long drive? Vents, chargers, cupholders - all necessary to make the trip comfortable. It is good to include seating position (how upright and supportive) as well as seat comfort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driver space&lt;/strong&gt; - How is the space in the driver&#39;s seat? Is the seating position good? How is the visibility, reach and access to all the essential bits?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driver comfort&lt;/strong&gt; - The big one for me is the seating position and getting in and out. I love a bit of thigh support, so adjustments and memory features score highly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passenger space&lt;/strong&gt; - Probably the same as the rear category but for the front passenger. It can be interesting to see how passengers are treated in some cars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passenger comfort&lt;/strong&gt; - As above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Range&lt;/strong&gt; - How far can you go on a charge?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recharge speed&lt;/strong&gt; - How quickly can it charge at home and out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive quality&lt;/strong&gt; - How does it feel to drive? I&#39;m looking for responsiveness of the throttle and brakes, the weight of the steering, the turning circle, and it&#39;s fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ride quality&lt;/strong&gt; - How does the ride feel driving on different surfaces, roads, and conditions? Does it feel like a moon buggy, or can you feel the bumps in your spine?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build quality&lt;/strong&gt; - Does everything fit together nicely? Do things look like they&#39;re flimsy and going to break? What materials are used, and might they be problematic?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;X factor&lt;/strong&gt; - Does the car do something the others don&#39;t? What makes it feel special?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annoyances&lt;/strong&gt; – I need to add this one after having struck off a few cars because of their new &amp;quot;nagging&amp;quot; features (dinging incessantly, taking control of things, not letting me take control). It might also be cosmetic and aesthetic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to weight each criteria and then score each viable option that passes the family test. So, there might be a few updates to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Test Drive Notes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a couple of links to longer reviews I got around to writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Really great car and driving experience. I love the brand ethos, but its not that cheap, especially the way pricing is done with feature &amp;quot;packs&amp;quot;. I didn&#39;t love the centre console, but if pricing was better I would easily look past that.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;It does a lot of stuff right, but I felt the interior felt cheap and weird material choices (velour style seats, nope). Also the driving aids drove me up the wall. Never has a machine pinged so incessantly by things I am more than aware of.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Tesla Model Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;I wanted to hate, but it&#39;s a great car. Rental was the base battery size, so that was the only issue. I can see why people like the car and the sold so many. But Elon.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;BMW i4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Great driving experience, but the battery and efficiency is problematic given the price.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;BMW X3M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Great driving experience, felt a lot smaller than the size of the car to drive. Is expensive and thirsty.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Cupra Alteca&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Great car - probably the right size for our family trip. Handled 2 adults, an almost-teenager, dog and luggage on very long drives. The downsides were the thirsty petrol engine and the fact that the ride was too firm on bumpy NSW roads.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Mastodon Comments</title>
    <link href="https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-12-mastodon-comments/"/>
    <updated>2025-01-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-12-mastodon-comments/</id>
    <media:content 
        xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" 
        url="https://heartsoulmachine.com/assets/social-previews/mastodon-comments-preview.jpeg" 
        medium="image" 
        type="image/jpeg" />
    <summary>Looking to add comments to a static site? Maybe try Mastodon.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Around this time last year, I started working on this blog. It was a project I really got my teeth into, and I had a few must-haves. The biggest was that I wanted it to be a static site - just files on a server - with no backend, database, admin, or maintenance required. I also wanted to have the whole thing run on files - markdown in particular - so whatever I wrote was easy to reuse and repurpose but stored and accessed without needing a website or technology to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up the site using  Eleventy (11ty) to do all this. I’d been a Jekyll user before and had encountered a few limitations that 11ty didn’t have. Being built in JavaScript rather than Ruby meant there was a larger community of developers engaged and a lot more portability of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the missing features of a static site is the lack of Web 2.0 features that enable user-generated content, such as comments. So essentially, the site has been operating as an OG weblog - and I liked that. Just me and some words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then along comes agent provocateur Jim Groom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://social.ds106.us/@jimgroom/113746590194162654/embed&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-forms&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest over the last year I have looked at a few options to add comments but I didn’t find many that didn’t leverage specific publishing systems (Netlify, GitHub) or weren’t a paid for service. Given this site currently costs me the fee for the domain and that’s it - paying for a service is not a cost I will bear. Also, IM not doing this site for clicks or user engagement, the only metric I’m worried about is my output and post count.  and while the site currently sits on GitHub Pages given the current rate of enshitification I didn’t want to move away from having the freedom to FTP the site anywhere and point the domain at somewhere new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at Jim’s behest, and using it as motivation I resumed my search, but this time I went to the search bar with a specific question – can you use Mastodon for comments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started here because I could see that Mastodon and ActivityPub could be an awesome way of combining blogs and interactions into the future. And while my simple 11ty blog wasn’t going to be able to run as an ActivityPub server - it had a lot of what’s needed to connect into that eco system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what I found was, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fietkau.blog/2023/another_blog_resurrection_fediverse_new_comment_system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Yes! Yes you can use Mastodon for comments&lt;/a&gt;. A number of posts discussed how they’d gone about it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cassidyjames.com/blog/fediverse-blog-comments-mastodon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;were sharing their code&lt;/a&gt; - so I thought how hard could it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well surprisingly simple! In about an hour I’d managed to copy the code, integrate, test and style it - and as a version 1.0 I’m very happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my end I copied the code that Casey wrote - his c&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cassidyjames/cassidyjames.github.io/blob/main/_includes/comments.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;omments template&lt;/a&gt; (which includes the js file) and the associated css files for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cassidyjames/cassidyjames.github.io/blob/main/_sass/_comments.scss&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cassidyjames/cassidyjames.github.io/blob/main/_sass/_avatars.scss&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;avatars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there I made a couple of tweaks to the variables used - and added those to my template metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;commentUsername&lt;/code&gt; = your Mastodon name (the first @)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;commentHost&lt;/code&gt; = your Mastodon host (the second @)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;commentId&lt;/code&gt; = the Mastodon post ID that refers to the blog post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tweaked the setup for 11ty - so I&#39;ve put the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timklapdor/heart-soul-machine/blob/main/src/_includes/partials/comments.njk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;comments template&lt;/a&gt; as a Partial that I can include in my template and I have the template pull in the comments section only if there is an Mastodon post ID is linked. This was to give me an opt in to comments - some posts I might not want them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve already set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://echofeed.app/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;EchoFeed&lt;/a&gt; which automatically posts to Mastodon via the sites RSS. So once I&#39;ve got that post - I can add the idea back into the post and republish. So rather than automatic there is a manual step - but it also gives me the power to opt in and out. Choices are a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a comment ID attached to the post then the template will pick that  up and add the comment template - which all works client side via the Mastodon API:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{%- if commentId | length -%}
  {% include &amp;quot;partials/comments.njk&amp;quot; %} 
{% endif %}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from my end that&#39;s it. I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2023-07-31-mastodon_blog_comment_system/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fabrizio Musacchio&#39;s post&lt;/a&gt; which added some other features - an API token so you can get more than 60 replies etc. But I also noted that he&#39;s not using his own Mastodon comments on the site... not sure why. I&#39;ll keep looking at this and see if any other features might be useful to add and poke around old posts and see which ones to add comments to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Learning Type Iconography</title>
    <link href="https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-07-learning-type-iconography/"/>
    <updated>2025-01-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-07-learning-type-iconography/</id>
    <media:content 
        xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" 
        url="https://heartsoulmachine.com/assets/social-previews/learning-type-iconography-preview.jpeg" 
        medium="image" 
        type="image/jpeg" />
    <summary>I created my first set of icons last year. Encapsulating an idea in a simple visual was much more challenging than I thought.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wanted to bring the &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning-types.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Learning Types&lt;/a&gt; to life and give them a more visual identity that extended beyond the colour scheme I&#39;ve adopted for their use. The process was challenging! I dived into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenounproject.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Noun Project&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration and to explore what was on offer. While there are a few icons that I liked, nothing actually fit the bill, and what was there was a mishmash of styles, but rather than move on, I thought to myself — &amp;quot;I can do this&amp;quot;, even though I never had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&#39;ve worked in graphic design I hadn&#39;t ever needed to create an icon set. Singular icons and logos, but never a set. So this was new territory, and something creative to get my teeth into, which I really needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey started with sketching out ideas for each of the learning types: Assimilative, Investigative, Formative, Discursive, Productive, Evaluative, and Social. I wanted to create something visual that conveyed the concept and meaning I wanted people to connect with. To be honest, I don&#39;t know how well that comes across, but I&#39;m very happy with the result, and for a personal project, that&#39;s what counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I did want to record what I was going for with each icon, at least for posterity&#39;s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to use a line-based style and something that worked at a larger size, as these would never be used for navigation or a user interface. I liked the process of trying to keep things consistent and balanced while providing a quite different visual for each type of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve linked some themes and concepts to visual components used throughout the set of icons to give them some consistency and overlap through a shared visual language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circles&lt;/strong&gt; – I’ve used circles to convey where knowledge lies. In some cases, they represent individuals; in others, they represent spaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dots&lt;/strong&gt; - These represent &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;. In some cases, it is the knowledge that individuals already possess - and so is shaped by that; in other cases, it resides within the space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagonals&lt;/strong&gt; Represent the space for learning, often indicating where it occurs. I like the sense of movement and activity these provide, which helps capture the dynamic nature of learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Icons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/assimilative-icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Assimilative&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim was to capture the merging of new information with what already exists. The crossover point, the diagonal lines, was key to trying to capture the process of assimilation of new information with existing knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/investigative-icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Investigative&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I wanted to capture the act of seeking and finding, so this icon was formed by trying to convey possibilities and pathways. While there is a defined path, there are also options to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/formative-icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Formative&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to capture the idea of taking oneself into a new space. Sure, there is a blank canvas there, but also a sense of wholeness moving into it. We take what we are and know into something new through the act of trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/discursive-icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Discursive&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here was about sharing perspectives. The circles here are the individual - opposites to each other but share the same conversation and discussion in the centre - the vertical lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/productive-icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Productive&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is obvious, but making and growing something is how I envision this kind of learning. Growing from the seed of knowledge already developed, the learning comes from the branching and unfurling of new leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/evaluative-icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Evaluative&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of learning is focused on feedback and reflection, so the imagery tries to do that by comparing two states. Rather than going for a tickbox, the idea here was to capture change - not correctness and to illustrate that through a reflection of the two states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/social-icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Social&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this icon, I wanted to visualise a shared learning space and that the knowledge exists within the space rather than the individual. Here, the crosses represent individuals with different orientations and perspectives, but they each contribute to the shared and accessible knowledge at the centre.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Review of 2024</title>
    <link href="https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-07-a-review-of-2024/"/>
    <updated>2025-01-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2025/01-07-a-review-of-2024/</id>
    <media:content 
        xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" 
        url="https://heartsoulmachine.com/assets/social-previews/a-review-of-2024-preview.jpeg"

    <summary>It&#39;s a week into the new year, but I am still trying to plan it out and come to terms with 2024.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2024, I did something different. After a lot of walking and pondering, I sat down and wrote out my values and goals. I hadn&#39;t done that before, so it was new and challenging. Honestly, I&#39;d &#39;achieved&#39; all the things I had set out to do in my youth (job, family, house, material things), and I was floundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot of soul-searching and reworking, I came to the point where I could confidently state that my two values boiled down to Understanding and Independence. I also wrote up a mission statement to contextualise those values into a way of doing and being:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is complex, but I seek to understand it. That means moving, changing and being dynamic. Life is experiential. I want to see the world — walk it, taste it, see it. I will be accountable for my actions, seek to tread softly and make choices that are good. I want the world to learn, starting with myself, then my family and those I can touch. Through learning, I can create opportunities for understanding, compassion and friendship. I want to have independence and help others achieve it so that we can live openly and honestly, being true to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s almost a year from that work, which included a plan for the year and setting some goals, so I figure I better hold myself to some account. I worked on the premise of having six areas of life and setting a long-term vision for each, as well as a 5-year and 1-year goal to aim for. This worked great in giving me a direction for where life was heading, and I felt a lot more focused throughout the year - things were happening, and I was moving towards something significant for once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let&#39;s review the specifics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Career&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start experimenting with my own business. See where I can create value and a reputation. Look at passive and active incomes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in this I made some good ground here. I got myself a couple of websites up and running, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning-types.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;learning-types.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://patternlearning.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;patternlearning.co&lt;/a&gt; and overhauled &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning-patterns.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;learning-patterns.com&lt;/a&gt;. I even found time to be creative and create some &lt;a href=&quot;https://alt-adl.fun/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;alternative logos for the university&lt;/a&gt;. I presented them at several conferences and got some constructive and encouraging feedback. In terms of income - well from an active space there are workshops that I can run and I plan on getting a half-day, full-day and a design sprint model up and running in the new year. I got a good taste and I am keen to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Relationships&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Connect with new people by exploring new social spaces and opportunities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not the biggest gain, but some progress. I carved out some time in the week to be more social and did a few events with different people throughout the year. It&#39;s challenging to make new friends in your 40s, but I think just operating in more social spaces is enough. I do hope in the new year that some more travel and getting outside of my comfort zone might help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3.  Physical Health&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loose weight, low carb eating, keep exercising and sweat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating habits have changed quite a bit this year so I&#39;m happy with that. I am walking everyday with the dog but have sucked at getting the sweat count up. I had a massive lull during winter and I need to look at how to counter that — I think I was also sick for about a week and that really knocked the momentum I had. The weight is a bit of a yo-yo — it&#39;s gone down and up, mostly down for the moment (which is good) but I need to work at it more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Inner-Personal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build on my international network. Participate and reach out to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too bad. I caught up with Alan, Kate, Grant, Lindy, Julie and a few others during the year, and it was good for the soul. I need to make more of an effort - and go back to doing some Zoom sessions. I wonder about podcasting as a motivator to reach out and reconnect, and there is also a plan for an overseas trip in 2025, which will force me to contact people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Finances&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start a new business bringing in new income.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made $0 new dollars this year from anything I did. I never really got the momentum behind me to get the workshops out to the public and start looking for paid gigs. The job got in the way, not necessarily with extra hours but by dominating my headspace. I need to work on this some more and create more space for myself and my career goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Rest &amp;amp; Recreation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To let go of control. Create space and margin by not extending myself. To take time out for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmmm. This is a tricky one as there are aspects and periods where this has been true, but I don&#39;t think I nailed this one. Control is certainly something I struggled with, and while I lived with its loss in many ways this year in my job, I don&#39;t think I went along with it willingly. In fact, up until the last week or so, I actively fought against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A retrospective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quick notes using our work retro format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking the dog and doing big walks on the weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking and talking out ideas has been great and made me more productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weekly notes because daily is too much for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning and thinking of the future and being in a mindset to think about it is important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding ways to be creative and making stuf, because I need an outlet I control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Falling off the wagon with hard exercise, be consistent all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caring about the job and the organisation - it&#39;s not reciprocated in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wasting time on Reddit - has not been helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscribing to stuff. Find stuff &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; and not scroll endlessly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double screening - the phone has to go away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Start&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning more rigorously. When I planned, I was better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OKRs - Be more constructive and accountable to myself and my planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching movies more often and appreciate the escape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage my time better - lets not waste it, and direct it towards where I need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have more than one exercise to do. When winter comes, have a fallback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a group to join and find a non-digital creative outlet to expand my options and create opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring the family along – I can&#39;t do it alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>AI says tomato but you mean potato</title>

    <summary>AI has become a container word and something that we can no longer discuss until we start to unpack and define what exactly we&#39;re talking about.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The fact that AI has become an inescapable component of daily discourse, news, and debate has been wreaking havoc on my sanity over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s become apparent is that by adopting the term AI, Sam Altman and his contemporaries have intentionally muddied the waters when it comes to what’s imagined vs what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a bit of a stickler for definitions, mostly because if you want to socialise ideas, discuss them, and collaborate on them, you need to be on the same page. You need to have a shared understanding of what you’re attempting to discuss so that you don’t talk past each other, conflate ideas, or have clear boundaries for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s certainly what’s needed regarding AI because, right now, every discussion, think piece, critique, report, and press release has an entirely different interpretation of what AI is and what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI is used as a container word - a useful tool in language that captures a broader concept - like traffic. What is traffic exactly? You know it as a concept, but you can’t discuss traffic in and of itself - you have to break it down into the many things it contains – from cars, pedestrians, people movement, flow, signage, signals and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between traffic and AI is that traffic has known components. The things the word contains are properly defined and can be discussed. That’s not the case with AI. What’s inside the container is an absolute mess of concepts and ideas that lack shared understanding and definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; when you say AI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you referencing Large Language Models? The software? Applications, Intelligence as a process or philosophy? Reasoning? Labour? Algorithms? Copyright? Machine learning? Hardware? Probability? Mathematics? Chat interfaces? Image recognition? All or none of the above? Do the people involved in the reporting, decisions and discussions about AI have any knowledge as to what any of these components are or what they mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term AI has been colonised as an integral part of the hype cycle required for VC firms to dupe people out of their money and transfer more wealth to the 1%. AI as a concept has been enshittified right out of the gates. If we want to have proper conversations about it, we need to break away from the container and start talking about what’s inside, including the nuances and differences between the tomatoes and the potatoes. Because swapping out the tomatoes for potatoes in a recipe, despite the fact they sound similar, will give you very different results!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2024 - A Wrap</title>
    <link href="https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/12-31-2024-a-wrap/"/>

    <summary>In what has become a ritual – a way of saying goodbye to the year and marking another time around the sun – it&#39;s time to wrap up 2024.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s start with some of the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasmania&lt;/strong&gt; – In April we headed to the Apple Isle to see some friends who also moved from Wagga at about the same time we left. It was a lovely time hanging out with them - especially seeing our girls enter &#39;besties&#39; mode. They&#39;ve been friends since daycare, and it was so great to see how quickly and easily they slotted back. Tassie is such a gorgeous place. I&#39;d forgotten how small it all is - only 570,000 people in the state!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt;—There was a bit of a resurgence in music over the year. It started with seeing Mr Bungle, a heat-stress-inducing WOMAD, a new guitar, TISM, and finishing with playing at DaveFest &#39;24. I&#39;ve been noodling away since we moved to Adelaide, and it was great to actually play with others. It is also the perfect motivation for next year and playing more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt; – It was a saga and an ordeal, but in the end, we have a kitchen where everything works, everything has its place, and it looks good!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals &amp;amp; Direction&lt;/strong&gt; – I really did start the year off in a worse place than I had. I took all of January off to sort myself out and took the time and effort to work through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefocuscourse.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Focus Course&lt;/a&gt; which helped me find my way. Over the year, it&#39;s paid dividends in helping to orient me to what&#39;s going on, and I feel like I have more focus on where I need to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the professional side of things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Types&lt;/strong&gt; - I focussed some time and effort this year on building out the work around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning-types.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;learning types&lt;/a&gt;, which has been underway for a while. I set up the website, made icons, and then started to work on workshops and activities aimed at utilising them in different learning and teaching practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OE Global&lt;/strong&gt; - It was a great conference full of international participants. I got to present my work on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/11-19-an-open-design-system-for-learning/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Learning Design System&lt;/a&gt; and catchup with Alan and Grant - and enjoy some Queensland humidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Career not Job&lt;/strong&gt; - One of the things that came out of the Focus Course was detangling my career from my job. They aren&#39;t the same thing and often don&#39;t align. The job is something you get paid for, but your career is something you pursue that gives you value. I assumed they were one and the same and linked them together, so when the job was going pear-shaped, so too was my career. In retrospect, I was putting too much into my job and not enough into my career. That was something good to come to terms with this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Growth and Change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reflection, this was a year of personal growth and change. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2023/12-31-2023-a-wrap/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;finished last year on a downer&lt;/a&gt;, but this year, I&#39;ve been on the up. I&#39;ve made steady progress on embedding and changing practices around how I live and do things. There have been plenty of external changes and chaos, but I&#39;ve felt more equipped to face them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt good about exploring my creative side this year – designing, making, and playing. I know I need to balance working and consuming with creating and producing output. Getting that balance right is always tricky, particularly when things get tough, but I know working towards it is important for my mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Merger, Merger, Merger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, my work was almost exclusively focused on the merger (the University of Adelaide and the University of South Australia are merging into Adelaide University). I&#39;ve really tried to influence things positively but have struggled with the organisation&#39;s hierarchical nature and how it&#39;s been structured for this change. The lack of collaboration has been telling, and trying to move away from a deeply collaborative model of work to a ... whatever you want to call what is happening... has not gone well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have had far more of a positive impact had I been able to influence decisions along the way. Instead, we are now stuck with a complete mess (one that I did predict and have been trying ever so hard not to say, &amp;quot;I told you so&amp;quot;). I&#39;ve been neutered as a manager and am unable to really support my team through the process, although some how that&#39;s still an expectation despite not being able to adjust anything about how they work other than approving leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am wondering if 2025 will be the year that a some industrial action takes place. There is a lot going on and a lot expected to happen in the coming year. If I&#39;m honest, I&#39;m kind of looking forward to the fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year ended with the completion of a pretty big project. Over three years of work went into planning, establishing, designing, developing, and creating two fully online programs. I saw my team expand from two to six and faced the many, many challenges involved in creating courses on a strict timeline and short timeframe—not once or twice, but 38 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my career perspective, pulling everything together has been rewarding. I&#39;ve grown into managing and developing a team, making good products, and stepping away from the doing side of things to take on a management role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a job perspective, it&#39;s not gone the way I had hoped for most of the time. I&#39;ve never had any recognition of the work that went into making this a success. I&#39;ve not formed part of anyone&#39;s strategic planning, in most cases, completely ignored and overlooked. There&#39;s been no progression of the role nor support for growth - despite being here for 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incompatibility between career and job has forced me to spend a lot of the year contemplating if the two match up in any way, shape or form. With the way things have gone with the merger, they have only diverged more and more. So at the end of the year - despite wrapping up the biggest and longest project that I have worked on (from start to the very fucking finish) - it&#39;s felt completely underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that said - I love who I work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love my team (in all its various iterations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work with a bunch of talented and good people. I love that they challenge me. I love that they see the world differently. I love that they bring themselves to work. I love that they feel comfortable to be themselves. I love being in a room, shooting the shit, but also working through some horrendously complex situations together. There is a great sense of camaraderie, which probably comes from shared trauma, but it is good to go to work and connect with these people. I found my people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I spoke a bit about the people aspect of my work. It was all off the top of my head in an interview style - but I think it got to the point really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the right group of people together and creating an environment that fosters collaboration - that&#39;s when the magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <summary>The last month of year and the final journal post.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It definitely felt like the end of the year, and I was pretty low on energy throughout December. There were many social events leading into Christmas, and I spent almost a week with my family over Christmas. At the end of it, I feel a bit peopled out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work got increasingly messy as roles, outputs, and responsibilities all came crashing into each other because no one (&lt;em&gt;in charge&lt;/em&gt;) had the foresight to plan any of this. I ended up everywhere and nowhere and spent the vast majority of my time in meetings about work, rather than doing any of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some great social events in the lead-up to Christmas, and I needed the distraction. There was a lot of drinking and merriment along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big one for me was my friend Dave&#39;s 50th birthday. Rather than a standard party, his family organised a gig to play his favourite songs. The band consisted of his kids, Ben and Nick, and “special guests.” DaveFest 2024 was a great night out, and as one of the invited special guests, I had to learn six songs to play—only two of which I was familiar with. It was great to get up and perform - something I have not done for sooooo long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also the last month of having an old friend in town. It&#39;s been great having a close old friend in town and getting to hangout on a regular basis. I am going to miss shooting the shit and debrief about work and life - but glad it was a thing for a while. We headed out on a couple of drives during December - down the Fleurieu and over to Yorke Peninsula to see some of the sights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent some nice time outdoors despite some of the hotter days. Got to see my first &amp;quot;shark spotting&amp;quot; with a plane overhead circling what must have been a large shark just off the beach I was walking on (not swimming).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas was nice - loud and crazy with all of the nieces in fine form. We went back to Wagga - or, more correctly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rock,_New_South_Wales#&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Rock&lt;/a&gt; - where my sister now lives. We travelled via Mildura on both legs as we took Frankie with us and found a pet-friendly hotel on the way. I enjoyed stopping off in Gol Gol (the NSW side of the river) and being close to the water. I got the chance to catchup up with Ben and Rob from &lt;a href=&quot;https://26fifty.com.au/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the good &#39;ol days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/timklapdor/albums/72177720314386151&quot; title=&quot;2024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54237063451_e7f9b4acfd_b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; alt=&quot;2024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watched&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got through &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt27995113/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Black Doves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt10466872/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dune Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d recommend them, but they were OK. I watched Birds of Prey with Ms. A, which was good fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Listened&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got my podcasts on while away and really enjoyed the Motor Doping saga of &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/ghost-in-the-machine/id1723841408&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ghost in the Machine&lt;/a&gt; and the social commentary of &lt;a href=&quot;https://stak.london/shows/the-english-disease-legacy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The English Disease&lt;/a&gt;. While at first, I thought football hooliganism would be interesting in itself, I loved where this series went - more into the class structures, social issues and misogyny that are deeply engrained in the violence and prevalence of the sub-culture.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2024 and what I&#39;m using</title>

    <summary>Going back to my Uses page and looking at what&#39;s changed over the year.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;📨 Mail Client: &lt;s&gt;Mail.app&lt;/s&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://canarymail.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Canary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (free) + Outlook (work)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggled to find a mail app I liked to use that does the simple things right. I don’t need 100 automations or AI summaries - I want a search that works and finds the email from 6 months ago. Canary does that really well. The interface is simple and easy to use, it has the right functions I want, and I’ve been able to get away with the free plan so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ To-Do: Obsidian &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;Things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent this year trying to get my shit together and have honestly found most apps wanting. I’ve got a decent thing going in Obsidian, but I did a big GTD dump into Things during the year and I love how it’s all organised. That said, I spent soooo much time in Obsidian that having to go into a different app to manage that seems to get in the way. I’ve found a few plugins recently that might help, as I love the workflow I’ve got in Obsidian at the moment and just need a couple of simple functions for it to be my full-time organisational app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📖 RSS: &lt;strong&gt;Readwise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
📑 Read It Later: &lt;s&gt;Pocket&lt;/s&gt;, &lt;s&gt;Omnivore&lt;/s&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Readwise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to lump these two together, and I decided to dump some $s down for Readwise. I’d started the year using Omnivore and enjoyed the annotation features and syncing - and then they shut it down. After a couple of tests, I figured Readwise did everything right - in particular, having an option to voice-generate the article for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📜 Word Processing: &lt;strong&gt;Obsidian&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;s&gt;and Word&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian has gobbled up word processing for me. I might do a copy and paste into Word at the end, but in terms of writing - Obsidian, hands down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📊 Spreadsheets: &lt;s&gt;Google Sheets&lt;/s&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Excel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t opened any Google tools for the past year. It’s odd, as Google Docs was a previous mainstay, but I guess when you don’t need to collaborate as much or your organisation has shifted to whatever Microsoft offers (&lt;em&gt;Shitpoint&lt;/em&gt;?), you don’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🖥️ Presentations: &lt;s&gt;Powerpoint&lt;/s&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ia.net/presenter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;iA Presenter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big plus for me this year was going in on iA Presenter. This markdown presentation tool fits my way of working to a tee, allowing me to create, develop and write up my talks quickly and easily. I’ve usually had to swap out to PowerPoint for the delivery format (conferences now lock down the computers to use to avoid all the tech woes), but this, too is pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🍴 Meal Planning: &lt;strong&gt;Reminders.app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminders for a couple of interesting updates this year, one was the ability to create Kanban boards. Creating a simple Backlog and days of the week was easy and a nice way to do this planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No significant changes, but I have to give an &lt;strong&gt;Honorable Mention&lt;/strong&gt; to my &lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro 2&lt;/strong&gt;s, which received quite the workout over the last year. See my Podcast Diet and add a healthy dose of audiobooks and plane travel. These bad boys have outperformed anything I’ve ever owned: sound quality and noise cancellation far beyond what you reasonably could expect from such a small package. I hope the next version adds some of the Smart Case features that the Jabra models have, allowing you to plug into a plane&#39;s entertainment system and stream the audio to your Pods. Also, I’ve never really got great feedback from the sound quality of calls from my end - I can hear them fine, but sometimes they can’t hear me particularly well would love some control over that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>You are what you consume — and this is my podcast diet for 2024.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Off the back of a couple of good posts from others (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2024/12/11/podcasts-im-listening-to-in-late-2024/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Doug Belshaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bryanalexander.org/podcasts/podcasts-im-listening-to-in-late-2024/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bryan Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cogdogblog.com/2024/12/podcast-listening/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Alan Levine&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laurahilliger.com/models/podcasts-im-listening-to-in-late-2024/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Laura Hilliger&lt;/a&gt;), I thought I&#39;d do a bit of a wrap-up of the year in podcasts. My devouring of podcasts was pretty substantial this year. They&#39;ve been a core part of my media diet for a few years, but this year especially as I&#39;ve tried to be more active and do more chores around the house - podcasts have been a great companion along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s start with the heavy hitters and the regulars from my subscribed list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://darknetdiaries.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Darknet Diaries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I stumbled into this series right at the beginning of the year and consumed the entire catalogue over the first few months of the year. The series has given me a much deeper understanding of cyber security and threats through the stories told and a lot more affection for the work involved in not only breaking in, but keeping people out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Behind the Bastards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Long time fan, and this year I caught up on the back catalogue and am now up to date. I&#39;m a huge fan of Robert Evans and his style, and I appreciate the care he brings to the topics he tackles. This isn&#39;t a read of Wikipedia highlights; these are deep dives into the lives and deeds of some of history&#39;s biggest bastards! Recommend: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/episode/czm-rewind-kissinger-parts-1-3-138228148/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kissenger episodes&lt;/a&gt; with the Dollop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/pivot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pivot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve been listening to Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway since the beginning and them as a duo works for me in a way that their solo podcasts don&#39;t. I like the vibe and personalities clashing a little. This year though it&#39;s got a bit harder to listen to as the bubble of wealth starts to show more and more and you can see a real disconnect between the hosts and the everyday lives of everyone else. I still find the discussion interesting and is the closest I will come to any real &#39;business&#39; reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dolloppodcast.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Dollop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another backlog catchup is complete! I do love the Dollop and the simple premise of the podcast - one comedian reads the story, the other improvises off it. The stories are really good and interesting - although I cannot do any more baseball ones. Recommend: The Reagan episodes with Patton Oswald.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iheart.com/podcast/139-better-offline-150284547/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Better Offline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A new podcast with Ed Zitron, in which he goes hard at technology, Ed&#39;s critique of tech is pretty no-holds-barred, and I appreciate the honesty and passion. We need more people in this realm attacking the bullshit that represents tech reporting in the media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techwontsave.us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tech Won&#39;t Save Us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
More critical tech, but Paris Marx leads the charge with a slew of invited guests sharing their expertise. Recommend: &lt;a href=&quot;https://techwontsave.us/episode/177_big_tech_wont_revitalize_indigenous_languages_w_keoni_mahelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Big Tech Won’t Revitalize Indigenous Languages&lt;/a&gt; with Keoni Mahelona.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Hard Fork&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a good example of the &#39;tech reporting in the media&#39; mentioned above. Casey Newton and Kevin Roose represent the mainstream in this space, with most of the news fuelled by press releases and interviews with whoever needs to get in front of the microphone to schill. I respect them - but their over-positive role in the hype machine is a little concerning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchengine.show/listen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Search Engine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve enjoyed P.J. Voight&#39;s solo project and the stories he tells. I like that the topic and format is pretty broad and unexpected (I really didn&#39;t think I needed to know about getting into an exclusive German dance club) and I&#39;ve also enjoyed some of the deeper &#39;less fun&#39; episodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/if-youre-listening&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;If You&#39;re Listening&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Matt Bevan&#39;s If You&#39;re Listening has changed over time and for much of this year has been a weekly new update that takes an in-depth look at a specific conflict or issue in the news. We also had a special America&#39;s Last Election series within the season. Recommend: I haven&#39;t watched the YouTube channel - but it is worth it for the punchy editing and visual layers it brings, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzEp-Vr4Oao&amp;amp;list=PLDTPrMoGHssAfgMMS3L5LpLNFMNp1U_Nq&amp;amp;index=40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;like this footage from Iran&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Hemispheric Views&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the only &amp;quot;guys having a chat&amp;quot; podcast in my feed. I really enjoy the dynamic of these guys and the community they&#39;ve built around them. Recommend: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Battle of the Defaults&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://defaults.rknight.me/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;App Defaults&lt;/a&gt; craze it created is a great place to start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, there were also some fabulous series I found incredibly engaging:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theoutlawocean.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Outlaw Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This podcast opened up an entire world to me - every episode opened my eyes to something new that did, was and is happening out in international waters. Recommend: All of it! All seven episodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifbookspod.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;If Books Could Kill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So technically, this is more episodic, but I found the whole series to be worth the investment in time. Michael Hobbes and Peter Shamshiri have a great dynamic, and the process of deconstructing these &#39;airport best sellers&#39; is fantastic as it plays down the hype and finds the nugget of truth (if there is one) - and I don&#39;t have to go and read these stupid books. Recommend: Given the hype around teens and social media -&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzsprout.com/2040953/episodes/15546366-the-anxious-generation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Anxious Generation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://snafumedia.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;SNAFU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Two great series on some hidden stories that exist out there. ABLE ARCHER 83 –  The NATO military exercise that almost started a real nuclear war and Medburg – The story of a daring heist that exposed a colossal FBI SNAFU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sceneonradio.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Scene On Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another long-running series. I only got through a couple of seasons this year as I find them challenging and deep. These are deep explorations of cultural phenomena, and they challenge beliefs and understanding. Recommend: This year, I tackled &lt;a href=&quot;https://sceneonradio.org/men/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sceneonradio.org/seeing-white/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Seeing White&lt;/a&gt; - I 100% recommend them both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://longshadowpodcast.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Long Shadow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This year, Long Shadow covered &lt;a href=&quot;https://longshadowpodcast.com/podcasts/in-guns-we-trust/episode-01-gun-violence-is-american-problem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;In Guns We Trust&lt;/a&gt;, which was a deep dive into guns and gun culture in America. I still don&#39;t entirely understand it, but this series really does try to explain it. As an outsider looking in on America, guns are something I cannot get my head around and this series probably does more to confirm my beliefs than challenge them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/expanse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Expanse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve been reading the books the sci-fi Expanse series, but this is not that. This is just well crafted and made storytelling. Bringing tales from Australia to the forefront and telling them really well. Recommend: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/expanse/series-2-from-the-dead/103684426&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;From the Dead&lt;/a&gt; season is my favourite - had never heard the story before and it was gripping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001324r/episodes/downloads&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Coming Storm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Coming into the 2024 US election, Gabriel Gatehouse dives into the Deep State conspiracyland and the absolute craziness that now inhabits the Whitehouse now that Trump is moving in. Be prepared America - it&#39;s going to be wild.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-presents-ultra&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ultra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These two seasons from Rachel Maddow are intense and scary. I had no idea how embedded fascism had become in post-WW2 America, but my god, it was scary, and it never went away. Really engaging storytelling and some truly amazing stories that need to be told.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0011cpr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Things Fell Apart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Season 2 of Jon Ronson&#39;s Things Fell Apart is another season of stories from the culture wars. Rather than retell or dive into the current maelstrom, Ronson goes back in time to try and find the original source - the pebble thrown into the pond and caused the ripples we experience today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brazen.fm/podcasts/fur-loathing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fur and Loathing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I had no idea that one of the largest chemical weapon attacks in US was set off at a Furry convention, hospitalised 19 people and remains unsolved. This is an interesting dive into the world of furry sub-culture and what happened when it was attacked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <summary>OK, we are now eleven-twelfths of the year done. It&#39;s been a busy month!</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job has been busy. I&#39;m representing my colleagues on the new Reference Group for Curriculum Development, and I found out I was co-chairing it as well. In November, I worked across about ten courses, running workshops, developing slide decks, drafting some style recommendations, and building course sites. It was not what I imagined at the start of the year, that&#39;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other aspects of work have been a bit dramatic as the process we&#39;re working through is starting to unravel under its own weight. I pushed hard early on that the approach wasn&#39;t suited for what needed to be done, but higher-ups decided to go with hierarchy over experience, and we&#39;re now seeing it officially not working. For example, I, an experienced manager, people leader, and project lead, am now building courses because they won&#39;t employ casuals to do that work. And that&#39;s because no one set up any systems to capture any data about what work needed to be done, who was doing it, and how much there was. I am sure there is a German word for the situation where schadenfreude includes yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the month ended with some really positive conversations on leadership and the need to change. I hope there is more of that, and that it happens quickly. The idea of doing this for another year is ... schadenfreude?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clare and I both had some time away from Adelaide — she headed up to Sydney to hang out with her Dad and Sister, so Ms 12 and I had some fun hanging out together.  We had our first &amp;quot;family planning&amp;quot; session to work together on what we want to be doing in 2025. The new year is looming, and we will have a teenager starting a new school, so it was good to chat about what that meant, but also what we had as shared goals as a family and how we could work towards them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s November, and I am feeling those strong end-of-year vibes. Although I got close several times this year, I didn&#39;t burn myself out. Recognising that has been a win for the year. I am feeling more positive now than I did a year ago. I am hoping to go into 2025 with a plan for the year - rather than recovering for the one just past... so I need to make some time during December for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got my turn to be away and headed up to Brisbane for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://conference.oeglobal.org/2024/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;OEGlobal Conference&lt;/a&gt;. Old friend Alan Levine was part of the OE Global team putting on the show and I figured I would put in a proposal to share some key aspects of my work. I got to give that presentation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/11-19-an-open-design-system-for-learning/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;An Open Design System for Learning&lt;/a&gt;, on the Thursday and it was great to bring everything together for that session. I&#39;ve got a lot of value in personally sharing my work, and so this year has seen me take some time out to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was good, but it was surprising that so many of the same issues were present despite the fact that the last time I worked on anything open was probably about seven years ago. The sessions were pretty Library-heavy, as opposed to learning and teaching, which I do understand as a lot of focus has shifted to Open Textbooks and now to Open Journals. I met some really interesting people working on exciting things, so it was a good learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brisbane is normally hot and humid at this time of year and it did not disappoint. That said I did enjoy the weather - the lushness that it brings and the absolute joy of watching a thunderstorm (not so much when you&#39;re stuck in it!). I do love the skies in Brisbane - they have a drama all to themselves. I also explored a little more of the town this time - heading over to the Valley to hang out with Grant Potter and to Eat Street on the Friday night for some drinks and food. There is one thing that I adore about Queensland, and it is the nighttime culture. It&#39;s warm and beautiful and so liveable and pleasant. So it was great to eat, drink and chat those evenings out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, I hired a car and took Alan up into the hinterland. While Brisbane is great — the hinterland is spectacular. We didn&#39;t have the weather on our side – our morning was a complete washout as it bucketed with rain. So we drove through it North and then looped back through the Glasshouse mountains in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following week I went to&lt;a href=&quot;https://dddadelaide.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; DDD Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; and by the time that was finished my brain was full!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/frankie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Frankie on his third birthday&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth noting that Frankie turned 3 this month as well. It is hard to think back to when he was a puppy, but flicking back through the photos so much has happened. I was never a dog guy, but I&#39;ve enjoyed having him around, and yeah, I love him - he&#39;s very hard not to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/timklapdor/albums/72177720314386151&quot; title=&quot;2024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54174108049_33d2ec24ba_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; alt=&quot;2024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watched&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the start of the month fully immersed in The Expanse - rewatching the TV series and smashing out another audiobook in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended it watching the fat suit glory that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt15435876/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Penguin&lt;/a&gt;. Also viewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt6263850/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Deadpool &amp;amp; Wolverine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt12789558/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Listened&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smashed through the second season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0jn1f4d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Coming Storm&lt;/a&gt; which was excellent and the fourth season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/expanse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Expanse&lt;/a&gt; on crop circles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Weaving some thoughts on what&#39;s happening at work and on the socials and reflecting on what I should be doing. Staying in the fishbowl, or jumping into the ocean.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h3&gt;The Fishbowl and the Ocean&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I ran a fascinating workshop with &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/catspyjamas.bsky.social&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Joyce Seitzinger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/kimtairi.bsky.social&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kim Tairi&lt;/a&gt; about being a networked professional. Each of us took turns running different activities, exploring how we thought about ourselves and our networks. It was the kind of workshop where we didn&#39;t just facilitate it, but we participated in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What stuck in my head from that workshop was &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/fishbowl.jpg&quot; _target=&quot;blank&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the map I made&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn&#39;t geographic but symbolic. For myself, I drew a picture of a glass fishbowl with a large goldfish in it. The bowl sat atop the ocean. Inside that ocean were all the other things going on in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s how I felt — &lt;em&gt;a big fish in a small bowl, looking out at the ocean&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for that analogy. One was simply geographic. I lived in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;a regional city&lt;/a&gt; of about 60,000 people in rural Australia. I worked at a University in learning technologies, and my position was unique within the organisation. Over time, I connected with a few others in Australia who were doing similar roles, but it still felt like I was in a very small fishbowl. Through blogging and Twitter, I discovered the ocean—seeing bigger things out there and engaging more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I never ventured into the ocean. I stayed within my fishbowl and looked out. Little snippets of what I said occasionally made it into the ocean; it might attract a little flurry of attention, but it passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Moving the Bowl&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t grown out of that analogy. Five years ago, we moved to Adelaide. The move held promise—working at a more prominent and prestigious university—but it’s still a fishbowl. My work has been internally focused, with little external engagement beyond our partners. There was no culture of sharing or publishing our work. At the same time, it didn&#39;t sit on a shelf — the work was practical, and my team used it to create our course development process. We were too focused on getting things done and never promoted the broader impact of our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I&#39;ve taken a few of opportunities to start to build that external component out. To put a few things out into the ocean again and see what happens. I started to lob things back out into the ocean and try to work outside of my bowl. I revisited a project I began years ago and built out sites for the learning framework we&#39;d developed using learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning-types.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;types&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning-patterns.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt;. It started as something quick and easy for my team, but something I could do with my skillset. Two weeks ago, I presented at the OE Global conference, discussing how these elements fit into a broader &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/11-19-an-open-design-system-for-learning/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;learning design system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project where we developed and implemented this system has ended. The university is now consumed with the merger between the &lt;em&gt;University of Adelaide&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/em&gt;. Despite the marketing promises of co-creation and collaboration, my experience has been hierarchical and exclusionary. The system we built aligns perfectly with merger goals — it isn’t being used. Decision-making remains centralised and opaque, driven by personalities or committees to hide behind. It’s deeply frustrating to see good work sidelined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my efforts, I’m still in the fishbowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Social Fishbowl&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve been reflecting on how to make 2025 different. Part of that reflection involves breaking the bowl and moving into the ocean. That prospect is terrifying — the ocean is full of unknowns, predators, and challenges. But it’s also where things thrive and grow. I&#39;m thinking of turtles, salmon, and eels that head out to grow and develop in the sea (and where most of the little ones get eaten!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past weeks, the mass exodus from X and the hype around platforms like Bluesky have dominated discussions in my social spaces. Mastodon has provided me with a more intimate, algorithm-free space where I and others feel safe to be vulnerable. It feels like a fishbowl in its own way, in that it&#39;s not the ocean. It feels safe, calm and small. But the ocean represents a bigger audience and broader connections. The appeal of platforms like BlueSky or the old Twitter was the ability for ideas to make a splash and create waves of engagement. In contrast, fishbowl spaces foster smaller, more personal interactions. While valuable, they lack the reach needed to broaden opportunities — opportunities that are increasingly linked to careers and livelihoods. They also come with dangers — lock-ins, spam, trolls and another Elon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Bluesky, I can see the draw of visibility, audience, and connection. Social media in these ocean spaces create moments of frenzy — drops in the ocean that sometimes spark meaningful interactions. Conferences and platforms provide similar opportunities for connection. I see the attraction and why, like moths to a flame, people are drawn. The ocean is as amazing and full of life as it is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Organisational Fishbowl&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I feel I’ve outgrown the fishbowl of the university and the inertia of deeply hierarchical organisational structures. The politics, hierarchy, and a lack of autonomy have become stifling. I don’t feel in control of myself or my work for the first time in over a decade. The absolute grind of turning up for that every day is demoralising, and it conflicts with my core values of independence and understanding. I&#39;ve tried to advocate for change and &lt;a href=&quot;https://timklapdor.wordpress.com/2016/05/19/leadership-outside-the-hierarchy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;proposed changes&lt;/a&gt; to what&#39;s going on and contribute to making &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universities have become organisations that seem incapable of &lt;strong&gt;meaningful change&lt;/strong&gt;. They change regularly, but it&#39;s never meaningful - just another cycle of centralising or decentralising, restructures that look like the old ones, and unnecessary workforce turnover because the organisation cannot recognise the difference between labour and knowledge. The &amp;quot;change management&amp;quot; process has become a pseudoscience—an empty ritual that justifies pre-made decisions. Universities are institutions of learning that fail to learn themselves. They repeat mistakes, default to hierarchy, and rely on consultants to rationalise their choices. It’s maddening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Breaking the Bowl&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to break the glass of my fishbowl and explore the ocean. I can feel the pull of the waves. That’s where I need to be.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>This presentation was given at the OE Global 2024 conference in Brisbane, Australia, on the 14th of November 2024. </summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The conference was on Open Education, and my aim for this presentation was to share the work I have been doing in developing elements of a Design System with the idea of providing it as a start to an open practice for learning designers. It was a 20 minute presentation - so I do glide across a lot and not hit a lot of depth as a result. This is a bit of a test for presentation posts, I&#39;m assessing the value of putting a talk here vs slides. Obviously this has more narrative, but also a bit more effort to pull together. Anyway enjoy and feel free to give me any feedback (contacts at the bottom)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a design system?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off, I want to introduce you to Design Systems. They are common in web &amp;amp; graphic design - but not necessarily in other &amp;quot;design&amp;quot; disciplines. I have been leading a team of learning designers for the last few years, and one of the big challenges I&#39;ve been working on is developing a shared set of practices. A system for how we work. Given that learning design is relatively new as a profession, it made sense to apply something that works in another design discipline to this space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked this definition from the Interaction Design Foundation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A design system is a set of &lt;strong&gt;standards&lt;/strong&gt; to manage and scale design. It includes &lt;strong&gt;reusable components&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;design principles&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;guidelines&lt;/strong&gt; to achieve consistency and efficiency&lt;br /&gt;
— &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-systems&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;IxDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the benefits?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing a system must have some clear benefits, so let&#39;s look at them first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A design approach creates efficiency by reducing decisions and the work involved in making them. If this is your first time working on large projects, it can be difficult to grasp how many decisions need to be made and how many meetings, emails, research, and discussions are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of approaching each decision on a one-off basis, design systems provide repeatable solutions to common design problems&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/11-19-an-open-design-system-for-learning/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A systems approach to design reduces the number of decisions people must make which also helps to establish more consistent results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Facilitate collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A design system creates a lingua franca for the team developing the course. Having a language and a vocabulary to speak to one another reduces misunderstandings and talking past each other. When we can speak the same language and be on the same page, we can collaborate more effectively – especially when the work requires a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scalability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design systems embed the building blocks of design into teams and workflows to create consistent learning experiences, even when a design is distributed among numerous designers and other team members — academics, course authors, media production, and course builders. A shared language and shared components also mean that designs can be quickly developed by those without a huge amount of experience. By empowering the team involved, we can scale the resourcing requirements more appropriately and towards more important and valuable work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Actionable Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have components, you can count them. You can see how and for what they are being used and can then assess their contribution to the overall experience. Being able to &#39;see&#39; what&#39;s happening in your course allows you to seek out issues before they go live and, from a diagnostic perspective, understand your pain points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design sprints &amp;amp; iteration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A design system allows you to design faster and get more done in a shorter period of time. Ideas can be sketched out and planned faster by using components. A huge benefit of a design system is the ability to adopt a more agile development process, one that focuses on iterative development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/snowball-waterfall.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram depicting a snowball gathering size over multiple iterations, and a staggered waterfall similar to a staircase.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snowball not Waterfall&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of a linear process where we start at the start of a course and end at the end, we have adopted an approach where the work is more focused on building layers of fidelity and information across the whole, rather than focusing on a purely linear and piecemeal approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does a design system look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three key components involved in a design system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first is &lt;strong&gt;Principles&lt;/strong&gt; - the motivations &amp;amp; drivers for your project .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second is &lt;strong&gt;Language&lt;/strong&gt; - the words &amp;amp; the visual language that you will use across your project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third is &lt;strong&gt;Components&lt;/strong&gt; - the more elemental parts of your system. The patterns &amp;amp; styles that you can reuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did we do at the University of Adelaide?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help explain the use of a design system, let&#39;s look at the example through the work I&#39;ve been focusing on at the university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Principles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of course development focuses on the resources, the delivery, the teaching, the technology and the tools. But we were a team of learning designers, so it’s probably not a surprise that we wanted to shift our perspective and focus on learning. Our journey started by defining what we wanted the learning experience to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed the Adelaide Online Learning Experience&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/11-19-an-open-design-system-for-learning/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This framework consisted of five areas we wanted every course to address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contextual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personalised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These principles framed our thinking about the courses we wanted to develop. They became embedded in our processes, shaped our ways of working, and drove our decisions. If something didn&#39;t align with these principles, it didn&#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then needed to define learning and what it meant to us as a team to ensure that we had a shared approach. What we do in the Education space is related to learning, but it&#39;s often in an indirect way. We help create and build resources for learning, assessments of learning, instructions, and activities that promote learning — but at the end of the day, learning is not our domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person learns in their &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;own&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; way. I found this challenging to get my head around until I was introduced to &lt;strong&gt;schema theory&lt;/strong&gt; - the concept that our brains function as a map of connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/schema.png&quot; alt=&quot;A network diagram symbolising the connections between points, similar to a schema map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, we all develop our own schema, linking information with our perceptions, physicality, locations, relationships, sights, smells, and sounds. Learning is the ability to take new information, concepts, and skills and connect them to our existing schema — to make connections between things and add to our network. To learn, we must form a connection, so learning is the process of creating new connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Learning Types&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was agreeing on how learning is done — what students do to learn and make connections. Diana Laurillard helped by introducing the concept of Learning Types in her conversational framework, mapping the dialogic relationship between teachers and students. As a team working on asynchronous online courses that didn&#39;t really allow this kind of conversation, we needed to adapt these to our circumstances, and we took the opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Definition&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-1-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assimilative&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-1-bg&quot;&gt;Learning through presented information      &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-7-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-7-bg&quot;&gt;Learning by seeking information             &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-3-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formative&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-3-bg&quot;&gt;Learning by trying                          &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-2-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discursive&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-2-bg&quot;&gt;Learning by engaging with other perspectives&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-4-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productive&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-4-bg&quot;&gt;Learning by creating artefacts              &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-5-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluative&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-5-bg&quot;&gt;Learning through feedback                   &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-6-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social&lt;/strong&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-6-bg&quot;&gt;Learning with others                        &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed these seven learning types, describing how we form connections in our schema. Finding out the one that works is a challenge that depends as much on the topic as it does the learner. But having these types means that we can talk with our course developers, discuss learning, and find commonalities in our approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We paired these types with activities, and this became our shared language. If we wanted to create a specific type of learning - then it was paired with a particular activity for our course developers to complete. This made visible the kinds of work and where the effort is more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Activity&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Definition&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-1-bg&quot;&gt;Assimilative &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-1-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content&lt;/strong&gt;           &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-1-bg&quot;&gt;Creating information for the student to learn from.                    &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-7-bg&quot;&gt;Investigative&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-7-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-7-bg&quot;&gt;Curating information for the student to engage with.                   &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-3-bg&quot;&gt;Formative    &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-3-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice&lt;/strong&gt;          &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-3-bg&quot;&gt;Providing opportunities for learners to try things out.                &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-2-bg&quot;&gt;Discursive   &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-2-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;        &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-2-bg&quot;&gt;Creating opportunities to share and engage with different perspectives.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-4-bg&quot;&gt;Productive   &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-4-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;        &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-4-bg&quot;&gt;Students produce artefacts as evidence of learning.                    &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-5-bg&quot;&gt;Evaluative   &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-5-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review&lt;/strong&gt;            &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-5-bg&quot;&gt;Creating opportunities to learn from reflection and feedback.          &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-6-bg&quot;&gt;Social       &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-6-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interactive&lt;/strong&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;p10-6-bg&quot;&gt;Creating opportunities to learn from others.                           &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Activity&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p10-1-bg&quot;&gt;1. Introduce a concept via a video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p10-1-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assimilative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p10-7-bg&quot;&gt;2. An activity where students are asked to find their own example of the concept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p10-7-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investigative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p10-6-bg&quot;&gt;3. Share it with the group via the discussion board&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p10-4-bg&quot;&gt;4. Have a go at trying to summarise the concept into a meme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p10-4-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Productive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p10-5-bg&quot;&gt;5. Share and comment on other&#39;s work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p10-5-bg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evaluative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Learning Sequences&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We immediately noticed that a good learning experience does not consist of a singular learning type but is constructed by combining different learning types and arranging them in a sequence or lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-constructed lesson provides multiple connection points and opportunities to connect the lesson to the student&#39;s prior knowledge or experience. Because everyone&#39;s schema is unique, the more diversity, the greater the chance of creating connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/learning-sequence.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram showing coloured blocks representing lesson activities and those connected to different schemas through matching colour areas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good learning design increases the surface area for learning and the opportunity for connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Visual Language&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The learning types became an invaluable part of our language system. We associated them with the &lt;strong&gt;colour palette&lt;/strong&gt; here and used that as a visual indicator throughout our workflow – creating a cohesive visual language as well. The colours are used throughout our workflow to help define learning at different stages and levels. Recently, I&#39;ve added icons to add a visual descriptor of the learning type – but the colours are a feature used throughout our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/learning-types.png&quot; alt=&quot;A graphic showing the 7 learning types in differnt colour and an icon for each symbolising the type of learning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One that works in our planning and whiteboarding stage – in Miro – or via Post-Its&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/planning.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A course map showing a course structure of 12 weeks and blocks of learning types for each week colour coded to the type of learning.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our homemade development tool that we created to author, manage and measure our entire development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/developing.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot from the Smart Storyboard tool showing graphs for related learning types used in the course.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through to our reporting tools - allowing us to see the experience of learning in an unprecedented way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/reporting.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A donut graph showing the total number of hours in a course and matched to the different learning types.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Components&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An essential part of a design system are the components. These reusable elements speed up the process and allow work to be developed more quickly by short-cutting the decision-making process and having some ready-made elements that can be utilised. Components need to be small elements, building blocks and pieces that can be fitted together to form the whole. A common metaphor is atomic design&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/11-19-an-open-design-system-for-learning/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, where there are &lt;strong&gt;atoms&lt;/strong&gt; that form into &lt;strong&gt;molecules&lt;/strong&gt; that make up &lt;strong&gt;organisms&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Pattern Language&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a Pattern Language came from Christopher Alexander, an architect who wanted to empower his clients to define a space&#39;s features and functions. He realised that there were common &amp;quot;patterns&amp;quot; that could describe these features and functions and that these patterns could be reused to solve individual design problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of creating our own “pattern language” of descriptive design elements that can be used and reused across contexts, technologies, modes and modalities of study would be enormous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;No Templates&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/no-templates.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of a sausage overlaid with the text Templates with a strike through the word.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templates are the most common approach to developing courses at scale. They can help provide structure, but they do so in a restrictive way. They make the student experience one of repetition, sameness, and conformity, which isn’t the kind of experience we should strive for. Templates are fine for looks and consistency but not the experience or the kinds of engaging learning we want. Templates are the “sausage factory” for learning design, mushing everything together and squeezing it into the same shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach was to move far away from the template approach and embrace patterns. The patterns acted more like Lego bricks—pieces that can be recombined and shaped according to the specific needs of the course and discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I built a library of common patterns related to each of the Learning Types so that we could help develop and scaffold the creation of activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/pattern-library.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A screen shot of the pattern library available at learning-patterns.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They provide prompts for both the learning designer and the course developer, which can help shortcut the design process and make it participatory. These are grouped according to the learning type or activity and provide a prompt and scaffolding to aid the creation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example Lesson&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the learning types and patterns together allows us to create rapid prototypes and construct lessons quickly based on the information around the topic and the kinds of learning that suit what we want the students to learn and experience. An example lesson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/Lesson-Sequence.png&quot; alt=&quot;A stack of Lego shaped bricks that represent the different patterns pieced together to create a lesson.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting off with assimilative learning and provide an &lt;strong&gt;Orientation&lt;/strong&gt; to the concept,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, you might want to engage in some investigative learning, so we might ask a &lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt; for students to go away and explore — maybe to find a definition of the concept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might bring them back together and provide them with our agreed-to &lt;strong&gt;Definition&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You then provide more details about the concept and include an &lt;strong&gt;Explanation&lt;/strong&gt; of how it works in practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, you want students to put what they have learnt into practice, so give them a &lt;strong&gt;Case Study&lt;/strong&gt; to work through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once they&#39;ve completed that task, they can evaluate their approach to the case and &lt;strong&gt;Reflect&lt;/strong&gt; on how they made their decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This might be a good time to illustrate the concept with an &lt;strong&gt;Analogy&lt;/strong&gt;, something they can relate to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will then provide some &lt;strong&gt;Instruction&lt;/strong&gt; on how to use the concept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s essential for the students to see how that can happen, so you demonstrate how the concept can be applied using a &lt;strong&gt;Worked Example&lt;/strong&gt; where you walk through applying the concept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then next task is for students to go and find their own example of the concept being applied and &lt;strong&gt;Share Example&lt;/strong&gt;s with the class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They then write up their &lt;strong&gt;Observations&lt;/strong&gt; of what the class found, looking for ideas that are different or unique to theirs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson design is agnostic to the mode, modality, and technology available, using the learning types and patterns. Because it is structured and formed around learning, this same lesson can be adapted to run face-to-face, online, and using both available low-tech and high-tech tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the types and patterns is easy, and you can quickly outline an effective learning sequence. Using that iterative snowball approach might involve choosing the type of learning, assigning a pattern, and creating a couple of dot points. From that, you can iterate and add details as you go and change and evolve the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we have a large connection surface; learners can engage with the concepts in a variety of highly engaging ways. This learning sequence could be easily adapted to run online or in a classroom and tailored to suit the cohort of students you’re working with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/learning-sequence.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram showing coloured blocks representing lesson activities and those connected to different schemas through matching colour areas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Other components&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other components we have in out design system is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediaproduction.adelaide.edu.au/uoa-styles/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Style Guide&lt;/a&gt; for our LMS. This helps us know what things will look like in platform and aids the decision making process as well. It&#39;s been developed specifically for our LMS and needs - and is the least open part of what we&#39;ve done. I would recommend exploring some &lt;a href=&quot;https://designsystemsrepo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;web design systems&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where are we now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our system has been embedded into our practices. The &lt;strong&gt;Principles&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Language&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Components&lt;/strong&gt; support our design process and our collaborations. Three years on, and we have a process that is efficient, collaborative, scalable, data-supported, iterative, and adaptable. We&#39;ve been able to achieve a lot in that time frame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two fully online undergraduate programs consisting of 36 courses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&#39;ve worked with more than 50 academic staff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Produced more than 660 videos, 740 interactives and over 2300 images across those courses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built over 3000 pages of content and 6084 hours of learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve created some videos covering that work and the processes we&#39;ve developed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR5PW51ImJI&amp;amp;t=2s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR5PW51ImJI&amp;amp;t=2s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPv_zKrab7k&amp;amp;t=5s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPv_zKrab7k&amp;amp;t=5s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhXJx7BUwf0&amp;amp;t=4s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhXJx7BUwf0&amp;amp;t=4s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also created site for both the Learning Types and Learning Patterns that are open and available to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learning-types.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;learning-types.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://learning-patterns.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;learning-patterns.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our project is now wrapping up and the team is moving into other projects, but I am really proud of what we have created and can see a huge benefit of openly sharing what has worked for us and to seed the idea of a Design System for Learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where to next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the last couple of months pulling together the &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning-types.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;types&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://learning-patterns.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt; into resources available online. They are available for you to use - but I am keen to develop this further. If you&#39;d like to incorporate these resources into your own process, or have any discussion on how to do it and what is possible - please get in contact with me via &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:tim@patternlearning.co?subject=Contact%20via%20OEFlobal24%20Online%20Presentation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@timklapdor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>The saga is over! Three months since it started we have a finished kitchen... and other tales from October.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;m reeling from how quickly 31 days have passed! The big news — the kitchen is finished. It started the day after my birthday, on July 22nd, and all the jobs were finished on October 22nd. It has been an absolute saga - but it is now done! Everything works. We have a full suite of appliances and plumbing up and running. In between tradies we got motivated and painted the kitchen a new shade of white, so it&#39;s looking fresh! I am happy with the result... I just could have done without all of the drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it&#39;s been a bit of a month at home, it&#39;s felt busy. I&#39;ve spent a fair amount of time trying to clean up the garden - facing down a mountain of weeds. The sun is back and warm so there&#39;s been a few days to get out and enjoy the surroundings with a few nice long walks in Belair National Park and along the coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has been getting on. My team seem to be doing well, a couple are getting higher duties recently, and a couple have gone for other roles and got them as well. So, the team is going to change a bit. That&#39;s OK with me - we&#39;re not working as we once did, and to be honest, I expected this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am struggling with this &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; way of working. I&#39;ve gone from leading all aspects of a major project for the last three years to answering emails and helping people fill in paperwork. It&#39;s a real letdown, but it is what the job is, not what I am. I&#39;ve made peace with that this month and started to give less of a fuck the job itself. At the same time, I&#39;ve got really good feedback from a range of areas of my work - running workshops and working with academics on developing a new curriculum. I&#39;ve enjoyed aspects of it - but at the same time I feel like I&#39;m stuck in low gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes with my team have been weird but also a sign of the times. I&#39;ve been lucky to have a high-performing team and have worked to create that and a collaborative culture, which means my guys are all in demand and capable of stepping up into new roles. There is absolutely no recognition from anyone about what the effort took or how it was created - but we&#39;re not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_organization&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;learning organisation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got the OK to get some videos up on the official university YouTube channel - which I&#39;ll share in a different post - and while I had very little to do with them, they capture the team effort we&#39;ve put into Open Universities Australia programs the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other efforts - I&#39;ve been trying to get my shit together. As usual, at this time of year, everything feels like absolute chaos, but I feel like I&#39;ve been trying to get my head around everything. I&#39;ve tried a few things and failed, but I am learning what works. I still feel I am missing an actual routine and something I am in control of, but it&#39;s hard to balance all the things in play at once. I am flagging it now as a family task - and for us a unit to work on life in a more structured way, so we&#39;ll see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key events that I had nothing to do with were the increase in our clan size with two babies landing in October - Finley and Ellsie. Excited to meet these two humans in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs K and I went and saw the pre-tour TISM show that was a lunch time gig here in Adelaide. For anyone outside of Australia This Is Serious Mum are legends of the 90s indie scene bridging genres and taking massive hilarious swipes at everyone and every cultural phenomenon in the zeitgeist. In trying to explain them to my daughter it was definitely a feeling of “you had to be there” but I absolutely love them. Worth checking out &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zP--E3EpMmo?si=kd1HhiL0j1ePyPGs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Old Man River&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Ey3V6jxoolw?si=-PY3TIKHDNmeB3Oe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Whatareya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/njJr09msGOo?si=1MmkBvGVl2fqPw94&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;5 Yards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/tFc-ictzHKE?si=eXbFJ2mh7ovoYci_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; to get a sense of the band!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/timklapdor/albums/72177720314386151&quot; title=&quot;2024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54115523219_b9aaa750cf_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; alt=&quot;2024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consumed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have absolutely smashed the audiobooks from the Expanse Universe - &lt;em&gt;Leviathan Wakes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Caliban&#39;s War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Abaddon&#39;s Gate&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cibola Burn&lt;/em&gt; all done and dusted in the month. I do love the style of these, and they seem made for audiobooks and TV. I&#39;ve gone back to the show now with that extra bit of knowledge of the characters and plot and have been enjoying it. The casting is great in the show, but some of the changes to the plot I&#39;m not such a big fan of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a recent special series of Tech Won’t Save Us that I do want to call out - &lt;a href=&quot;https://techwontsave.us/episodes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Data Vampires&lt;/a&gt;. This series is a super engaging look at the growth and impact of hyperscale data centres and their effects on the communities, resources and environments around them. This is hugely relevant given the demands by AI for these systems, and how this contradicts the exact actions we need to be taking to avoid climate collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably more interesting was the last episode that introduced me to Nicolas Bostrom’s influential &lt;s&gt;theories&lt;/s&gt; fever dreams have completely distorted the discussions possible about AI and technology. In one of those serendipitous events I was also catching up on some saved articles after being forced out of Omnivore and switching things to Readwise. &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlewords.com/talks/superintelligence.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Superintelligenceg&lt;/a&gt; from Maciej Cegłowski not only does a great job explaining Bostrom’s thesis, but dismantling it with a simple set of counter arguments. Worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Our work to develop two fully online programs for Open Universities Australia has come to an end. Three years of work is a challenge to get your head around and try and capture in a meaningful way.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my career, I’ve had the pleasure of seeing a couple of large-scale projects come to fruition and finish. There’s always hoopla and hype at the beginning that fades pretty quickly once the work begins. But when the project lasts a couple of years, the end is, at best, anticlimactic. Most of the enthusiasm is gone by then. Instead, what gets you to the end is momentum and the ability to work as a team to get you through to the finale.  And once you’re there? Not much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience working in large organisations is that despite spending large amounts of money getting a project up and running, they forget the project ends. They fail to celebrate the effort taken to complete the project and that there was a real and tangible outcome to all of that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team and I have come to the end of a three-year project. There are a few thousand hours worth of work wrapped up in what we’ve done, which is to put two full degree programs up online to run in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open.edu.au/universities/the-university-of-adelaide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Open Universities Australia (OUA) marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. Each individual course has been designed and developed to be run entirely asynchronously without the need to attend any classes (they are optional), so a lot of content and activities have been created for these courses. They’re incredibly robust, well-designed, and professional. There are so many intricacies in each one of the courses that there are hundreds of examples of good practice, learning design and content authoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how the institution responds to a project drawing to an end, it was really up to us to celebrate what we achieved. The recognition for what we’ve done wasn’t going to come from the organisation, so we needed to celebrate our own efforts. One of the things that I’ve been trying to develop personally is thinking beyond the job and focusing on my career. That means that at the end of this project, the job is technically done, but from a career perspective, we need to make sure that we can reference our work in the future and demonstrate what we did during the project. The team is currently working on this, bringing together a portfolio site that will contain information about all the courses we worked on, with screenshots and case studies covering what we&#39;ve produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other part of this that we have been able to finish is recording what we&#39;ve done, utilising the skills across the team to develop three videos. The aim was to try and capture some key elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project overall &amp;amp; innovations behind the scenes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR5PW51ImJI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR5PW51ImJI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The design process we developed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPv_zKrab7k&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPv_zKrab7k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our reflections on the curriculum design process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhXJx7BUwf0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhXJx7BUwf0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve never made a wrap-up video like this, and I am proud of the result, even though this had little to do with me and was all my team. I actually don&#39;t mind being on camera!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team have now moved on to other work - we are all immersed in developing courses for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://adelaideuni.edu.au/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;new&amp;quot; university&lt;/a&gt;, and the courses will continue to run, but our work developing them is all done and dusted. While we start this project the aim is to pull together our portfolio site when we have time and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to capture 3 years of work is a challenge. The videos don&#39;t necessarily tell the story of the experience, they allude to it and the challenges we faced, but they don&#39;t tell it. They don&#39;t cover the trials and failures we encountered, the lessons learnt and applied, the evolving nature of the work and the different approaches we took. The &amp;quot;agile&amp;quot; approach we took that prioritised iteration over perfection, which challenged everyone on the team as nothing was ever done until now, when it is well and truly done. They also don&#39;t capture the relationships and how every individual involved grew and changed and adapted to face whatever was coming. At the end of the day it was a human scale effort, that required us to keep that constraint in mind even when the spreadsheets said otherwise. We developed a new design tool, created a best practice approach to course design and development, and all of us came out with new skills and experiences to draw on. I really have loved bringing this team together and managing the project through from it&#39;s rocky start through to today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I lack style</title>
    <link href="https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/10-07-i-lack-style/"/>
    <updated>2024-10-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/10-07-i-lack-style/</id>

    <summary>I realised that I lacked a positive routine after the bottom had fallen out. Some thoughts about constraints in a positive way to create a routine and style for living.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve spent the last couple of days trying to get myself organised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have notes and to-dos everywhere, across apps, accounts, and calendars. I have multiple pending to-dos and priorities. I have shows and series on the go and a desire to consume them all. I have a favourites list, bookmarks, and read-later lists overflowing with content. And I can&#39;t make head nor tail of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is a priority. And in that space, nothing is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything and nothing is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I was trying to find something I had read by Steph Ango but hadn&#39;t recorded somewhere in my notes. While browsing their blog unsuccessful in finding what I was looking for, I read a couple of Steph&#39;s small, concise essays. They are deep, considered, and quite beautiful in their own way, similar to a caligrapher&#39;s brush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest one &lt;a href=&quot;https://stephango.com/remove&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;What can we remove?&lt;/a&gt; and the line sprung out at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems want to grow and grow, but without pruning, they collapse. Slowly, then spectacularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like that&#39;s me at the moment. The last week was supposed to be a holiday. It instead just became a week away from work. Things had been getting wound up continually over the last few weeks, more and more piled on, and so this was supposed to be a time to unwind. But instead it snapped back hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a day in the car driving to Victoria, having put the dog into the kennel in the morning. The next day I received a frantic phone call from the kennels that Frankie was ill and bleeding everywhere. He needed to get to the vet, it was serious. We were lucky that one of my best friends had moved Adelaide in the last couple of week and was happy to be our emergency contact. I hadn&#39;t thought we&#39;d need him straight away.  We spent the day mostly panicked rather than relaxing while we waited for news. The next morning I was on a flight home, Frankie couldn&#39;t go back to the kennel and we were still unsure as to what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I landed the vet had given him the all clear and I could pick him up in the afternoon after they kept him on a drip for fluids and observation. He turned out to be fine, having had the equivalent of a panic attack at the kennels that expressed itself physically. He needed a couple of quiet days but by the middle of the week he was his old self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rather than a holiday I had time alone. I was hoping to use it productively - to get things done and do more of all the things. But I didn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched some TV and spent days in the garden weeding. It is the time of year when it&#39;s dry enough to get into the garden before it is overwhelmed with weeds. I listened to an audiobook and resigned myself to joining Frankie in recovery mode. I liked this post from Doug Belshaw about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7243961122557427712/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Four Work Modes&lt;/a&gt;, and realised that recovery is what I needed. Novelty had been where I had been operating for quite some time, reactive and scattergun without focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus. I keep coming back to that - and my lack of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s been too much on. Too much to focus on. My Job and House and Family and Work and Career and Finances and Relationships and Social and Recreation and Health and Spirituality - all the time and all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Four Work Modes, Doug pointed out that quadrants differ in terms of Energy and Routine. My Energy has been waning over the last few weeks, having been High at work for some time now. Now I was in Recovery, overstimulated and undernourished. What was missing from my experience was Routine. It&#39;s something I have been trying to work on since January but I&#39;ve found it hard bed one down that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walk the dog 6 out 7 mornings in a week. That&#39;s been good, except when the weather disrupts it. That change has been positive. It also doesn&#39;t seem to work in terms of making other changes - like going to the gym, trying to do that after a day at work has not happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steph has another post that clicked with me - &lt;a href=&quot;https://stephango.com/style&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Style is consistent constraint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Style emerges from consistency, and having a style opens your imagination. Your mind should be flexible, but your process should be repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My everyday life lacks &lt;em&gt;style.&lt;/em&gt; I&#39;ve never gone out of my way to define it, but style and routine are missing aspects of me. I have a style when it comes to work, writing, and creating—but not in living. I think this is mostly because I&#39;ve never given it a thought, just moving through time and space. Similar to January and wanting to define my &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/01-28-vision-week/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;personal vision&lt;/a&gt;, I just hadn&#39;t thought about it before. So that&#39;s my challenge now. To go and find my style and build out a more positive routine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>A busy month with a couple of new and refreshed websites, a workshop and a very welcomed friend is now living in Adelaide.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another month, huh?!?! Well, it&#39;s supposed to be Spring, but I am learning that doesn&#39;t translate to immediate warming or a sunny disposition here in Adelaide. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bom.gov.au/iwk/calendars/kaurna.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kuarna calendar&lt;/a&gt;, we&#39;re still in Winter or Kudlila, which runs through July, August, and September. In this period, the earth is washed (kudlinthi), and conditions are windy (wait). That matches! It&#39;s hardly been warm, and there seem to have been only a few glimpses of broad sunny days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, we still don&#39;t have a fully functional kitchen. I managed to get a local handyman to come in and help fix the floors so we could slide the new fridge into place, and I did move most of the items into the new cupboards and cabinets. The oven and dishwasher are working, but we are still in benchtop limbo, with a date of the 8th of October for them to be fitted. Once they&#39;re in, we can finalise the plumbing for the sink and get the cooktop in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work — the chaos continues. I&#39;ve resigned myself to not being in control or able to influence anything any more. It&#39;s defeating, but there&#39;s no point railing against reality. There have been some good moments working directly with Academics and getting them to rethink some of their existing strategies and assessments. The process is still so focused on individuals that we are missing the opportunity for broader change. I made alternative recommendations (and repeatedly argued for them), but we&#39;re continuing with a process that seems wholly inefficient and unsustainable over 18 months - but hey, that&#39;s the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that would have been the end, but I did realise that my job is not my career. While they tend to cross over, that&#39;s not always the case. So, while I&#39;ve been getting my work done, I&#39;ve also been trying to pull together more future-thinking efforts. Back in January, I made it a goal to run a Learning Design workshop, and last Tuesday, I did that at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://herga.com.au/conference-2024/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;HERGA Conference&lt;/a&gt; here in Adelaide. To get there, I&#39;ve been working away on a couple of projects - a big refresh of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning-patterns.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Learning Patterns&lt;/a&gt; website and developing two new ones - &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning-types.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Learning Types&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://patternlearning.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pattern Learning&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is to begin a side hustle under the Pattern Learning guise and offer some workshops and consulting options. So, I&#39;ve put a bit of effort into the branding here - trying to rely on my skills in design and what I can control myself. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.downes.ca/post/77058&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Stephen Downes&lt;/a&gt; put it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought on reading this is that this is clever branding. Tim Klapdor writes, &amp;quot;Learning Types is a resource developed to create and share a typology of learning to aid the design and development of engaging learning experiences.&amp;quot; We&#39;re all familiar with the categories, but I like the (b)right colours and logos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that&#39;s about right. The branding is important as it links a lot of my work together. The types are linked to the patterns, which will link to the processes I&#39;ve been working on and developing these workshops to teach. The workshop was just 40 minutes, but it was a good test of what I could cover quickly. I&#39;ve gone from a 10-minute presentation to a 40-minute workshop in a month and a bit, and I hope to have a full-day workshop by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also still have a software project in the background that we&#39;re hoping to commercialise, but that&#39;s not really in my hands to do anything about directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big event for the month was when one of my best and longest friends moved to town. He and I go back to year 4 in primary school, and it&#39;s amazing to have someone close by after five years of being on our own here in Adelaide. It&#39;s been great to have someone to hang out with in a way that is just second nature. He&#39;s also been there for us during an emergency with Frankie. I was supposed to write this post while relaxing with friends in Victoria, but I&#39;m at home alone with the dog. After a night at the kennels, the staff found him in the morning with blood everywhere. My mate stepped up and got him to the vet and stayed with him there till he was admitted and in their care. After a day of completely freaking out, I flew home the next day and picked him up from the vet. Nothing serious in the end, so we&#39;re very relieved and so glad we have a friend like that around!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few photos from the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kardashevstreet.com/2024/09/04/kardashev-street-planetary-energy-system-changes-at-street-level-a-talk-at-the-conference-malmo-august-2024/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kardashev Street: Planetary energy system changes at street level&lt;/a&gt;  - Like the way this article framed changing the energy system as a driver for change. We are so far below the potential to just capture what the sun produces, that just upping out solar production would be a game changer for the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watched&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished off Season 1 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Silo&lt;/a&gt;. It was my second attempt at watching, and I think I was in the right mood this time. This is a slow-burn style of show that builds over time, and while the resemblance to Fallout is undeniable, this is a completely different beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt15119154/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Life of Crime 1984-2020&lt;/a&gt; is a documentary that spans almost 35 years of filmed footage. There&#39;s no voiceover, it&#39;s all told through the protagonists, with occasional questions from the director, Jon Alpert. The film is a sad ride to the bottom for the trio of Freddie, Rob and Deliris. It&#39;s heartbreaking to see them struggle and try to redeem themselves and just fail so outright as they destroy themselves over time with drugs. There are patches of light and redemption along the way, moments where it seems like things will change, but ultimately, they are let down. More by a society that writes people off, rather than giving them a hand up, gives them a high five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Listened&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished off another season of Scene on Radio - this time &lt;a href=&quot;https://sceneonradio.org/men/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Season Three on Men&lt;/a&gt;. I do love this show and series - there are so many great moments and stories in there that really dig into men and masculinity. S03E11 - drops this bombshell on shifting from hierarchical thinking to relational - from linear to ecological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Biewen&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah it just becomes hard to say &amp;quot;I dunno!&amp;quot; The words Terry Real uses to talk about this issue are shame and grandiosity. He says, as a couples therapist, he spends a lot of time trying to help men &amp;quot;come down from&amp;quot; grandiosity, as he puts it. And to make a shift from hierarchical thinking - either I&#39;m winning or l&#39;m losing - to a relational way of being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terry Real&lt;/strong&gt;: When you shift from that dominant hierarchical thinking to relational thinking, you shift from linear thinking to ecological thinking. You&#39;re not above the system, you&#39;re a humble subcomponent part of the system, you live inside of it, and it&#39;s in your interest to keep it clean and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not above the system, you live in it. You are a sub component of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celeste Headlee&lt;/strong&gt;: Keeping the system clean and healthy. Whether the system you’re talking about is a relationship – say, a marriage – or whether you’re talking about the literal ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delusion of dominance is also important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terry Real&lt;/strong&gt;: The delusion of dominance over the feminine, including Mother Nature, will kill us. Let me be clear about the stakes. If we continue to believe that we are technologists above the rule of nature, nature will prove otherwise. And the consequences will be severe. And they are coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar thought-provoking episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://theinformed.life/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Informed Life&lt;/a&gt; the discission with &lt;a href=&quot;https://theinformed.life/2023/02/12/episode-107-michael-becker/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Michael Becker on Knowledge Work&lt;/a&gt; was really interesting. I really liked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Value is not created in your output. The output is the byproduct of your value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was interested to hear about Micheal when he discussed output software, and how that output shapes your thinking. I found the &amp;quot;shapeless&amp;quot; way of working in software like Miro, Obsidian and Markdown in general really interesting. Markdown for me has been a game changer, especially being able to write and present your ideas from the same document (see iA Presenter which I used for my HERGA presentation). With our software project I am starting to see that this might be crucial for us to get right and move away from a &amp;quot;locked-in&amp;quot; output we&#39;re currently working in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binged Season 1 and most of Season 2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-snafu-with-ed-helms-102539700/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;SNAFU&lt;/a&gt; this month. I love the story and the topics in both seasons. There&#39;s a really great movement and you can see the threads of the story being woven in each episode. I also loved the bonus episode discussion with Rachel Maddow about her Ultra series, which is similar in it&#39;s &amp;quot;uncovering&amp;quot; of a historical story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also SNAFU the acronym = &lt;strong&gt;Situation Normal: All Fucked Up&lt;/strong&gt;. I&#39;ll be using that more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Serendipity Engine</title>

    <summary>A somewhat serendipitous post about serendipity and designing for it.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few years ago a colleague and I were working on a tool to enable better organisation of groups for learning. The tool ended up being a combination of a simple survey and a couple of unique sorting mechanisms that we developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, we aimed to group &#39;like&#39; students together based on their answers - their location, area of study interests, etc. But during our discussions, we asked ourselves - what if we wanted to do the opposite? What if instead of grouping like students, we want to go the other way and group students together based on differences? A simple example might be grouping students by their preference for roles in a team, in that instance you would want a variety of roles in each group, not all of the same grouped together. But in other instances, you might group different students to create friction and possibility. That kind of sorting became known as the &lt;strong&gt;serendipity engine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;serendipity engine&lt;/strong&gt; groups learners in ways that increase the chances of serendipity - of sharing, discovery, connection, conflict - and learning together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#39;t a guarantee that anything would happen, but it increased the odds that something unplanned and unstructured would occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to enable group learning to be different and to create engagement by creating opportunities for collaboration, cooperation, sharing, and discussion and for differences to arise through the co-mingling of people and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By pushing different people towards each other with a shared purpose to produce something, we could create a whole variety of different learning opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it is through conflict and the creativity required to move past that which is where the real learning opportunity arises. Sometimes, it&#39;s in not dealing with the conflict and having to experience some level of disagreement and failure. There are so few real opportunities for us to delve into that process because conflict is one of those things where you have to be in it to learn from it and learn how to cope with it. It&#39;s not something you can just read about – it&#39;s experiential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all came up over the last week as I&#39;ve been thinking about how serendipity relates to my current work on learning design. I&#39;ve been developing my ideas around learning types and patterns and planning on running a few workshops on using them for learning design. I aim to get people to think about learning experiences more holistically and to think about moving &lt;strong&gt;between&lt;/strong&gt; different types of learning as ways of engaging with different types of learners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, a marker of the success of the learning experience is the variation of learning offered to students because each of these creates opportunities to learn - to engage with different types of students and connect with different ideas, concepts and experiences in their schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of our design is to increase the conditions for serendipity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And rather than fumbling through it, the concepts of learning types and patterns allow us to design for it. Rather than seeking to template everything by defaulting to the specific formats and structures that are so ubiquitous and forced on us by the technology and tools we use, what if we designed for serendipity instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what seems like a serendipitous occurrence - Doug Belshaw mentioned his idea of &lt;strong&gt;Serendipity Surface&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2024/09/08/weeknote-35-2024/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;his latest Weeknote&lt;/a&gt;. He outlined the term to describe cultivating an attitude of curiosity and increasing the chance encounters we have by putting ourselves out there. On this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5I92QO1_D4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;podcast on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; Doug describes coining the term Serendipity Surface to describe cultivating curiosity, increasing random encounters and possibilities by putting ourselves out there. He sees it as the opposite of reducing the &amp;quot;attack surface&amp;quot; in security; it&#39;s about expanding opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like that term, so perhaps the aim is to use the &lt;em&gt;serendipity engine&lt;/em&gt; to increase the &lt;em&gt;serendipity surface&lt;/em&gt; of our learners.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>A month of kitchen renovations is dragging on, I wrote a big list and found a bit of direction by doing so.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can winter end? It was another grey and cool weekend to round out August. We had a splash of warm weather a couple of weeks ago - a couple of glorious days of sunshine, but since then it&#39;s been back to grey skies, wind and rain. Temperature wise it&#39;s been very mild, but the greyness has got to me a bit and I am so looking forward to sunny days. Another week of this crap weather is predicted, so not a great start to spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month felt like things were going a bit off the rails, so I took a mental health day where I sat down and ... wrote a list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the most exciting thing in the world, but it is life-changing. The effort of just trying to clear my mind of the clutter was cathartic. In my teenage years of spiritual exploration, I dabbled in the occult and via the early internet stumbled into the writings of Aleister Crowley. One of the things that actually resonated was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Lectures_on_Yoga&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;his book on Yoga&lt;/a&gt;, where he described the process of emptying the mind. Rather than thinking of nothing, what was required was not the absence of thought, but to have thought through everything. By systematically going through each thought and thinking through it, you can reach a meditative state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the long anecdotal way of informing you that making a list of everything going on inside your mind is the only way to get clarity on what you actually &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for me, the list was very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I got out of the exercise was a bit more clarity on what was going on inside my head and why I felt troubled. There was just a lot going on, and my mind was bouncing from one thing to another. To that end, I went back to try and organise things out - putting things into categories and priorities. I forget that I need this to function... I tend to organise myself, go on that path for a couple of months and then everything falls in a heap, including me - mentally and physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubled down a bit on Obsidian as a way to organise my brain - and I keep coming back to Johnny Decimal as a practical way to manage other stuff around me. But at the same time neither is setup correctly yet — that&#39;s going to take some time and effort dedicated to it. What I did implement was some of Doug Belshaw&#39;s ideas from his &lt;a href=&quot;https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2020/06/23/not-everything-has-to-be-digital-my-analogue-daily-and-weekly-planners/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Weekly and Daily Planners&lt;/a&gt;.  During this period, I felt I&#39;ve needed something like this, especially as work has become much more unstructured. I haven&#39;t gone analogue or adopted this exact model, but I&#39;ve incorporated the ideas into my Week Note set up, which has been going really well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside all of the hype and drama of work, we&#39;ve been renovating now for over a month. Kicking off the day after my birthday, we sailed through July and into August without a kitchen. And the month has come and gone, and ... still no kitchen. There are cupboards but no appliances or plumbing. There are lots of semi-complete tasks and benchtops that need to be sorted before we can be anything like complete. There are also a few issues with things being straight, particularly the floors that mean our new fridge barely fits into its new spot, but more importantly, it can&#39;t sit level. So the drama will continue for another month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highlight and something very new for me is that I have a friend in town! One of my best mates has moved to Adelaide in one of the most seamless moves I have ever seen.  I&#39;m looking forward to having someone close by that I&#39;ve already connected with. New friends are great, but that old friend that already knows you, and you them, it&#39;s just so nice and comfortable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll add in some photos from August - and one thing that has been great is the light. Some of the sunrises and sunsets have been amazing (usually due to the way the low sun hits the clouds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/timklapdor/albums/72177720314386151&quot; title=&quot;2024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53963094543_d2b4a0e77a_b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; alt=&quot;2024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watched&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve sat through a few movies in August from &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt23289160/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Godzilla Minus One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt18412256/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Alien: Romulus&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt5177120/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare&lt;/a&gt; to some quality couch time with Alise watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt5463162/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Deadpool 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2404463/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Heat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TVwise we devoted our family time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1928307/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Time Bandits&lt;/a&gt; but also got through House of the Dragon (not going to recommend), The Umbrella Academy and making a big dent in &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Silo&lt;/a&gt;. There&#39;s also been some international rugby to watch as the Wallabies rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dealing with Burnout</title>

    <summary>Knowing burnout exists is one thing. Dealing with it is another. So too stopping it.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year, I attended the DDD conference and one of the presentations really resonated with me – the one about burnout. The speaker went through some of the symptoms, side effects, and manifestations of what burnout does, and it was a light bulb moment. “Aha, this is what people talk about when they talk about burnout.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recognised that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’d burnt out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, not just once but probably multiple times over the last couple of years. Each time it was slightly different - different circumstances and pressures, but it was still burnout. I vowed at the end of last year to make some changes in regards to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using some time off that I had in January I went through a really big reset on work and life. I needed a different perspective and worked through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/focus-course/&quot;&gt;Focus Course&lt;/a&gt; to help establish that and to be honest, I&#39;ve felt much better this year. But at the same time, work has really been challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re working through a university merger, which I think is the biggest ever. It’s all brand new (so we’ve been told on repeat) and so it&#39;s a major thing to deal with. I expected work to be hard this year, and it has been, but in very different ways than I anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d asked me a week ago, I probably wouldn’t have said anything about burnout. In a lot of ways I feel &amp;quot;underworked&amp;quot; from what I had anticipated. But this toot from Mandy Brown described burnout not just occurring because you’re busy but because you’re feeling under-utilised:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I oft talk about with my clients: the worst burnout I experienced wasn’t the result of overwork but of being underutilized and feeling useless. We have to get specific about burnout if we’re going to address it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://everythingchanges.us/blog/digging-through-the-ashes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://everythingchanges.us/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://mstdn.social/@aworkinglibrary/112922033290261155&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@aworkinglibrary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resonated because what I’ve been struggling with the most over the last few months is not too much work - but being ignored when it comes to my work and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a professional perspective, I’ve achieved quite a lot over the last five years. We are just finishing off the final batch of courses for our 7th fully online program for the university. I’ve been involved in all of them in different ways, they also resulted in me burning out and taking on lots of responsibility for getting things done. I did do this knowingly, I always figured that this was moving towards something bigger in my career. This was all an opportunity to learn, grow, change, and know what &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few months have not been that. The last few months have not been building on the expertise of myself or my colleagues, who’ve all worked on creating different programs and doing the work that we’re required to do right now. That is to do course development on an unprecedented scale and in very little time. The scale part is the new piece, but over the years myself and my peers have been doing this across multiple areas, projects and programs. This is what I&#39;ve been preparing for.... and now I&#39;ve been shut out. Rather than the leader I&#39;ve been working towards and taking on the challenge ahead, I feel completely disempowered to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we are, with me sitting here feeling on the edge of burnout. Not from stress and overwork, but from feeling useless and underutilised. And so now I&#39;ve recognised it, I have to think about preservation and pulling myself away from the edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means &lt;em&gt;unplugging&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;uncaring&lt;/em&gt; – doing less rather than more. Not taking ownership of things, not caring about the consequences of other people&#39;s actions. That&#39;s not mine to own or be responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Winter has set in, work is wild and a kitchen is being installed.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July just flew by. Probably because a lot happened during the month that&#39;s kept things busy. Ms A was away for a week visiting family during the school holidays, and the dog had a week at the kennels, so there were a couple of &amp;quot;quieter&amp;quot; weeks during the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My walking regime has been OK, but the gym completely fell of this month. I need to reconfigure my routine during August so that I am prioritising this time and burn off of calories. I think it would do my mental health wonders, but as always, these are always the hardest things to do when you&#39;re in a funk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work.... I don&#39;t think things have gotten any better. My complaint is the lack of planning or organisation regarding the work that needs to be done. I&#39;ve tried to intervene positively and prompt basic things like to-do lists and schedules to be developed and time put aside to collaborate, but nothing happened in that space. I think that&#39;s the end of me trying to change anything now. I have to draw a line when it comes to wasted effort, and that&#39;s now. There is no point in continuing to try and affect any change - there is absolutely no appetite for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course is set, and there is no turning back now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I am concerned about the effect this will have on my team and all the other personnel involved. No one seems to give a fuck anymore from a practical capacity about work and welfare. Sure, they say all the right words in public, but the reality is that every decision undermines trust, refuses to acknowledge any of the realities of being a human (getting sick, being tired, stressed and overwhelmed) and diminishes the key structures that allow people to remain resilient - the team and the people around them. Rather than seeking to build up the existing support structures, the focus is on some theoretical notion of leadership and teams that are so far removed from any practical reality you can tell that only people who lack any experience in this area could have thought it up. And rather than utilising the skill and experience at their fingertips, and against all advice they keep returning to their imagined reality as the way things will get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well my big event for July was my 44th Birthday. Unlike previous years, we did plan a bit of a celebration and a night out with friends feasting at Peel St and an after-dinner cocktail at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bibliotheca.com.au/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bibliotheca&lt;/a&gt;.  I also had a couple of pints of Kilkenny and a Chinese meal at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://brecknock.weebly.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Brecknock Hotel Corner Bar&lt;/a&gt; - an old pub that&#39;s been divided into a cozy homestyle Irish bar in the small front bar and a massive Chinese restaurant in the rest of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week after the biggest thing to happen to our home started - the kitchen renovations. Having dreamt this up almost as soon as we moved in, after about 3 years, we&#39;re finally underway... slowly. The unique angles in the house obviously played havoc for the cabinet makers during the installation, and we&#39;re now stuck without a viable kitchen as all the other dependencies kick in. We currently have cabinets in and benchtop templates ready to go to the stainless steel fabricators, but that&#39;s it. There&#39;s no more forward momentum until the benches are in, so no usable kitchen. &lt;code&gt;¯&#92;_(ツ)_/¯ &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a week of ongoing dramas with the installation - missing elements like taps and sink, new fridge not fitting through the doorway without requiring pin-point manoeuvring to get into the house and a few &amp;quot;hold my beer moments&amp;quot; with the other appliances. I think we&#39;re on track now, but it is a bit of a wait-and-see when it will actually be finished, so at the moment, the house is a mess, there are no usable benches for meal prep, and it&#39;s not fun attempting to cook anything at this point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also spoke at the TALAS Symposium - an opportunity to share practice and ideas with our UniSA colleagues. It was a good opportunity for me to share the work around Learning Types and Patterns that I&#39;ve been doing in the background. It also gave me the impetus to pull together a revamp of the Learning Patterns website. It&#39;s not 100% public (but if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning-patterns.com/test-index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;know where to look&lt;/a&gt;) it&#39;s up online so I can do some testing with it. I&#39;ve updated the CSS, now have a dark mode, and swapped out the entire site to be a single page with details popping up using the new Popover API! I&#39;m super happy as it&#39;s performant, works with Translation features and has almost zero javascript. Hopefully, pulling all of this into the public-facing version soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time as all of this is going on there are snippets of joy. There was a koala in our yard one morning! One of my best friends is moving to Adelaide! We climbed a hill and had an amazing view of a pod of dolphins frolicking in the bay! And the sunrises and sunsets have been spectacular - and I&#39;m awake to see them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Photos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooops - I forgot about June photos so added them to the Flickr album too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/timklapdor/albums/72177720314386151&quot; title=&quot;2024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53899609967_3e8b509ea9_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; alt=&quot;2024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Watched&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a bit of a stroll down memory lane with &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt3083016/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Axel F&lt;/a&gt;. The next season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt11311302/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Vikings Valhalla&lt;/a&gt;, which I like but it never quite gets me that into the story - I think maybe its the character switching - each of the stories are interesting, but you&#39;re constantly switching between story arcs. Also finished off the Boys and The Acolyte - both underwhelming but entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Listened&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some great podcasts I made my way through during July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both seasons of Ultra by Rachel Maddow - a really great and unknown story for me about the rightwing, and literal Nazis in American politics. So good and poignant and ultimately human story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smashed through season 2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001hf1w&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Buried&lt;/a&gt;. I love the story but hate the episode length. So frustrating that when you&#39;re finally getting into it and it ends, and then theres a couple of minutes of credits, ads and preroll. This season is on PCB contamination and the unlikely hero, Douglas Gowan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also went through  S04 &amp;amp; S05 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/cover-up-the-conspiracy-tapes/id1621750804&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cover Up&lt;/a&gt;, The Anthrax Threat and The Conspiracy Tapes. The Anthrax Treat was quite eye-opening in how wide-reaching and large-scale that attack was and that so many people died. The Conspiracy Tapes was something else, quite Jon Ronson in the sense of it going back and tugging on the threads back to the source of so much of the conspiracy theory culture that exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also finally got around to finishing up Scene on Radio&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://sceneonradio.org/seeing-white/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Seeing White&lt;/a&gt; season. I got a huge amount out of this series and thoroughly recommend it as &lt;strong&gt;one of the best explorations of race&lt;/strong&gt; out there. While the context is American, so much of the concept of &#39;whiteness&#39; resonates here in Australian society. A country that had a literal &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Australia_policy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;White Australia Policy&lt;/a&gt; has a lot to reconcile with, especially as we have grown into a truly ethnically diverse nation. The history, the topics, the stories and perspectives shared in the series really were amazingly compelling. It took me a while to get through the series, I&#39;ve had to stop and think at certain points along the way to really unpack what was just introduced. The latest of these was when the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markedness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Markedness&lt;/a&gt; was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Moving into winter now and half of the year has gone!</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well winter certainly descended this year. I felt it more than usual having switched to walking the dog in the mornings. The 6:20am wake up was now in complete darkness and so got to witness a few sunrises. We’ve had a few cold days - no frosts, but the days where it’s windy are icy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather has challenged my whole exercise regime. I’ve kept up my long walks with Frankie on the weekend, but I have not visited the gym that often. I find the short days of winter take it out of me. It’s hard to be motivated and stay motivated. There are quite a lot of personal projects that have not received the time they deserve, and part of that is just feeling mentally spent at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason for that is the merger. I’m now fully involved in merger work and being challenged by how things are being done. There’s a lot of rhetoric about codesign and collaboration, but they are just words on a page. There’s very little productive collaboration or engagement baked into any of the processes, and we are defaulting back to the good old hierarchy. And I’m so far down the ranks that it’s impossible to influence decision-making, flag risks, or contribute to anything meaningful. Despite 5 years of experience doing this exact thing, I, and most of my colleagues, have been siloed and ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the talk about well-being and being people-centred flies out the window in this situation. I keep trying to limit my personal investment in this thing - it is just a job, but it’s so hard to do that from a professional integrity perspective. I don’t let projects fail, I don’t let mediocre work continue, I don’t keep making the same mistakes. But that’s also when I can influence the process and what’s happening. I don’t have that now, so it’s just one frustration after another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the professional face goes on at work, but there are cracks. I know I come off sometimes as a critic, but offering &lt;em&gt;critique&lt;/em&gt; is not the same. It’s just that managerialism brings a complete lack of practicality or awareness of the work required. Knowing the jobs to be done is not the same as &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the job is done, which becomes more obvious daily. There’s a massive disconnect between the numbers on the spreadsheet and how to achieve the expected outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My beef comes from our current work that requires 1800 courses to be developed in 18 months, all produced in 10-week cycles. This is the first project I’ve ever worked on where no one can or will tell me, “What is a course? What are the expectations of what will be in a course within this time frame? What is the deliverable? What does ‘done’ look like?”. I have led projects, managed them, planned, developed, cost and implemented them from inception to completion - this is the first time I don’t know what we’re doing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, life outside of work has been good. My Aunt and Uncle visited. However, Frankie was not a fan of a new male in the house and made my Uncle feel quite intimidated. He is such a different dog around others, especially men in our home. I know it’s the protecting nature of the pack, but we will need to do some training on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one of the weekends, we headed out to K1 winery and did a tasting in their very pretty cellar door, looking across the pond and the trees still in their autumn hues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did manage to do one creative thing — building &lt;a href=&quot;https://alt-adl.fun/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Alt Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; as a parody to the branding due to be unveiled on the 15th of July.  Curious how it pans out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Watched&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21072112/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bodkin&lt;/a&gt; - watched with the family, a dark humoured murder mystery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt16418808/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sugar&lt;/a&gt; - interesting film noir style detective show with a bit of a twist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Listened&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been listening to a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://sceneonradio.org/seeing-white/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Scene on Radio&lt;/a&gt; over the last few months, but I got stuck on the Seeing Whiteness series.  I stopped not because of the quality, but because of an idea from Chenjerai Kumanyika - who spoke of &lt;strong&gt;Race as a Technology&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chenjerai Kumanyika&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah but I have to be honest. I&#39;m proud of Blackness but I&#39;ve come to see it less as my, you know, an identity, and more as, like, a technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Biewen&lt;/strong&gt;: Meaning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chenjerai Kumanyika&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, it’s kind of a weird word, but I see it as a technology because I see Blackness as not something that is hardwired into our biology, that just determines who we are. Instead it’s something that we use. And I have to think about it like that because I have to recognise the way that it can also be used against us. And when it&#39;s being used against us, I cast a sceptical and pessimistic eye toward it. Right? But, you know, I&#39;m trying to be sensitive to, like, where Blackness, where the technology of Blackness fails. You use that technology, and it doesn&#39;t tell you what you need to know about a group of people or a person. But also to navigate in this white supremacist country and to live with a sense of political clarity and joy and possibility, I also tap into that other side of Blackness I was talking about earlier. And I&#39;m optimistic about, you know, tapping into those resources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That stopped in me in my tracks and I needed to stop and think through that. I still want to unpack the idea more, but I&#39;ve started listening again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>A story to try an capture the feelings of working through a university merger. Based on personal experience and would differ wildly from other perspectives across both organisations.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote this post a few months ago when merger work was well underway. I didn&#39;t post it then, hoping things would change. But to honest they haven&#39;t. While progress has been made, each step along the way follows a script that&#39;s pretty similar to what&#39;s below, regardless of the size and scale of the individual piece of work. If I were to describe my view of &lt;a href=&quot;https://adelaideuni.edu.au/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the current state of the merger&lt;/a&gt;, it would be this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re an architect. You meet a client. They have secured financing, the buy-in of some pretty influential backers, and a mandate to build one of the greatest buildings in the world and put Adelaide on the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an architect, this sounds great. It&#39;s a dream job, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. So you sit down with the client to start forming a brief, but they’re distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s so much to do. We need to start marketing this thing, get the plans in, and get ready for tenants now!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you say sounds great, but let’s start with some fundamentals - what kind of building do you want this to be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The greatest. World class. We are going to be a magnet for overseas investment and visitors while providing a key service to the state.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s fantastic, so what is this building going to DO that allows that to occur?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, it needs to be flexible. We want the highest possible quality experience for everyone who visits. And for those who can’t make it, the same quality experience online! Yes! We have to have the greatest experience for everyone. This is going to make us world-class.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wow, that sounds amazing, but WHAT is IT? Tell me, what is the core experience you want to deliver?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, we need it to be modular so that people can customise their experience. We need flexibility so they can come to us from anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OK. So I think we still need to understand what are they coming FOR?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look, we want to be a people-first organisation, and we want to reflect the diversity of our people, their culture, and that of the First Nations. We have to be accessible and ensure we have people’s well-being at the forefront.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That sounds really worthwhile. But we want to get into some details now. In order for us to draw up any plans, we want to make sure we understand the function of the space. To ensure that we can build the best buildings, we find that knowing what you want them to be there for and what you want them to do while they are in the building is important. Mistakes made in planning can be really expensive later on. It’s best for us to get as full a picture of what you need, and we can do the design work and sort out the details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, that’s great. We need to get the plans off to the council in 15 days. We’ve set up meetings next week with our staff, and they will tell you what materials to use and the dimensions they come in. Ok, well, that was a great meeting. I have to rush! Have a branding meeting for the new logo. Bye!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They leave, and the door shuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your phone buzzes continually for a minute as 25 notifications inform you of meetings you’re now attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Another month, another update.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The month of May was when everything went off the rails. I came back from my travels, got sick and needed a couple of weeks to recover from that. It wasn&#39;t COVID, it wasn&#39;t the flu, but it definitely knocked me on my arse and I needed quite a bit of recuperation. The disruption to my routine really resonated throughout the month, and it just felt like everything struggled to get back on track after that. The last week, everything kicked back in, but man it took a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the vibe? Well I feel a bit lost. I need some time to get my head back in the game, but that&#39;s challenged by finding the time and space to do so. I need to get things back on track in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work-wise, we were in full steam in terms of merger work, which was good and bad. I really don&#39;t feel that the process was as productive as it could have been. But at the same time, I quite enjoyed facilitating the workshop and getting back to working more closely with academic staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Events&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aurora, or out attempt to go and see the aurora. Ms A and I packed the car with Frankie and hit the road to head south to where the best viewing was expected. As we drove away from home and the city we could easily see the pink glow through the windscreen. It was great! But we kept heading south... and then nothing. The aurora died down, and the clouds came in! It was a bit of fun, and we did see pink! No photos despite packing the camera and tripod. The next night we headed down to Moana beach and enjoyed walking the dog at sunset with the aim of hanging out till dark in the hope of another aurora showing. While there were no lights, the sunset was off the charts! Such amazing light - the moon was out, it was amazing! (see photos)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Watched&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt12037194/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Furiosa&lt;/a&gt; at a special screening put on by Krix Speakers where they had done a reference setup of the movie at the Wallis Cinema in Noarlunga. The movie itself was just OK - it was not anywhere near as good as Fury Road - but the sound! It was amazing. The seperation was amazing - nothing was muffled and the way that the V8 engines blended and became musical in the soundtrack was beautiful. There was also a lot of leather in the movie - so lots of squeaking I&#39;m not sure I would have heard before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt12637874/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fallout&lt;/a&gt; and loved the 50&#39;s aesthetic and quirky humour of the series. I&#39;ve never played the game, but I got sucked into the world very quickly. I do love the ethical and moral quandaries it deals with and the depth that it goes into. There&#39;s a lot to the series - and so I might need to pick up the controller for a play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms A and I watched both Dune movies together. I needed a bit of a reminder of the first movie before sitting down with the second. I was surprised with Ms A&#39;s attention span lasting for both movies (watched over a couple of weekend, not back to back). They are visually stunning movies and I loved the lore and soundtrack too. I would love a Krix cinema experience of it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Listened&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Season 3 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://longlead.com/article/long-shadow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Long Shadow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;In Guns Guns We Trust&lt;/em&gt; was phenomenal. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to understand guns in America. At the end of the day it&#39;s still a mystery that nothing has changed despite the carnage, but it was interesting to chart the history and learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great series was the ABC&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/expanse/roddans-diamonds/101358708&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Expanse&lt;/a&gt;. All three seasons are great, tackling the Argyle Diamond Heist, the sinking of the Blythe Star and the Pine Gap spy base. Each one is told by a different reporter and has it&#39;s own vibe and production, but each story is compelling and riveting. Perfect to binge on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>April 2024</title>

    <summary>April was all about connecting with friends and family.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h3&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April has felt like a big month. There was quite a bit of travel, social events, and family time packed in, which led to feeling quite disjointed and out of routine. Most weeks weren&#39;t full work weeks – they were broken up with public holidays and leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel bad about addressing most of my health goals and letting a lot of the big effort items fall to the wayside, and I have felt guilty about it. I also feel very tired, with the first 1/3rd of the year being full-on and a lot has been happening. That&#39;s led to a loss of routine and a real inability to stay focused and get things done. I&#39;ve got to put some time aside this next week to bring things back into focus and set my attention back on what matters. I can see that my default state is to drop back into being reactive, leading me to not make decisions, not communicate properly, and feeling scatter-brained in almost every aspect of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was due to do an audit of my Focus Course progress this month - I haven&#39;t done it, but I realise that I actually need to set aside some time to get it done. That said I feel a good chunk of the big picture items - my vision and values in particular - has really helped steer the ship and stay on course throughout the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I wanted to note - this was an unlucky month. On my trip to Wollongong I left cables and my kindle at a friends place, lost my glasses for the first time in my life (20+ years of wearing glasses!). I also had a trip to the emergency department for a minor issue. I&#39;ve come away wondering what&#39;s going on or if it&#39;s just my time for a streak of bad luck. Hopefully this is all for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Events&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The month kicked off with the Easter weekend which was some great family and social time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next week saw the start of the school holidays and the family headed over to Tasmania for 5 days. Some dear friends move over there a few years ago and we haven&#39;t seen them for a couple of years, so when flights were on sale during the school holidays I jumped on them and booked us in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasmania is the smallest state in Australia, an island off the island (or mainland, a word you only use in Tassie!). It&#39;s been 14 years since Mrs K and I had been there last, one of our first &amp;quot;grown-up&amp;quot; holidays. I thought that Tassie had been through a boom since then, you here a lot more about in the news as it&#39;s become popular with retirees, but the reality is that the state&#39;s population is still very small, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;571,165 people&lt;/a&gt;.  Driving through Hobart I was expecting it to be bigger, but it&#39;s just a dot in terms of a city with a bit of sprawl up the river Derwent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up the river we went to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Old_and_New_Art&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MONA&lt;/a&gt; – the Museum of Old and New Art. The largest private gallery in the Southern Hemisphere MONA is a statement. I&#39;m not 100% sure what it says, given the owner David Walsh made his money as a professional gambler, but the museum seems to be hewn out of the rock and contains a broad and eclectic collection of art and artefacts. There are strong themes of sex and death throughout - and in some cases it comes across as a bit try-hard and teenage-angsty. But at the same time there is a uniqueness to the works and the experience over all. There were a couple of works that I really enjoyed – the Fat Porsche being one - but MONA is more about the experience, and some of the pieces just need to seen, heard and smelt. Speaking of the experience - I feel really sorry for the army of teenagers and 20 somethings required to be employed simply to tell older visitors not to touch the artworks. Having spent a large amount of time being around toddlers in my life, these Boomers were incredibly disrespectful and annoying, wanting to poke and prod the artworks in every space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then drove our hired Tesla Model Y (which I will review) through the gorgeous countryside to Launceston. We met up with our friends in their new home perched high on the hill above town and were back in the groove quickly. Our girls had been together and best friends in daycare, and they just slotted back into their ways within minutes. It was great to see their friendship, which had been pretty distant, spark up again so quickly. They were inseparable for the rest of the time we spent there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, we descended into the rainforest, completed a maize maze, went to the beach, wandered the city, saw some monkeys, visited a winery, drank a lot of Pinot Noir, climbed a mountain, and genuinely connected with our people and the country. For the last evening, we drove back to Hobart to spend time with our extended family there and got to enjoy the views from their amazing house and the experience of the most sincere hospitality on the planet! There was also an afternoon of whiskey cocktails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After arriving home we quickly washed Ms A&#39;s clothes and the next day she flew up to Sydney to spend some time with her Aunty, Uncle and cousins. I went back to work and ran some workshops to aid the design of courses for the new university as part of the merger work, which was ... interesting. It wasn&#39;t organised well, so there was a lot of on the fly problem solving - but we were working with a great group of people throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a nice, quiet adult weekend where we probably tried to recover from a very hectic week before I flew off to Wollongong for my uncle&#39;s 70th birthday. It was a bit of a family do, and it was great to see my mum, brother, sis-in-law, niece, aunt, uncles and cousins growing family. We had a great long lunch with amazing Italian food and carried on at my other uncle&#39;s local haunts. I had some time to catch up with a prior colleague, Lindy, and catch up about life, the universe, and everything over a meal and a bottle of wine. I also got to see Kate, catch up on the family goings, and discuss the state of higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Photos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite action-packed and some great photos to boot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48074786@N06&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53668429641_0228e1443d_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Watched&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s Super Rugby season, so a lot of Rugby! Watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1136617/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Killer&lt;/a&gt; - which wasn&#39;t great, and binged through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2934286/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Halo&lt;/a&gt; - again not great but held my attention for 2 seasons (but I am a sucker for Sci Fi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Listened&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t recommend enough &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theoutlawocean.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Outlaw Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. This superbly reported and told a set of stories gave me a real insight into a world I knew very little about - what actually goes on out at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Recollection of March 2024 - what&#39;s been happening in my part of the world.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h3&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March this year was a lot of fun from the family and social aspects. We spent a lot of time together as a family, getting out and doing stuff together. Ms A. has settled into high school life and has started making new social connections and so we have had a bunch of visitors to the home. This has led us to the discovery that Frankie has a &amp;quot;self-defence&amp;quot; mechanism where he excretes a god-awful rotting fish smell when strange men (dads sent in to pick up their daughters) come into the house! He&#39;s all bark and no bite, but the smell is savage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started on our V2 of kitchen renovations, so I&#39;ve been busy pulling together our ideas into a format for the joiner to draw up some plans and give us a quote. That&#39;s taken up a large part of my creative energy for the last couple of weeks. I&#39;m really happy with the result - maybe less so with the cost, so I&#39;m hoping we can make a couple of changes to reduce some aspects, and now it&#39;s off to the bank to see about a loan. We&#39;ve been lucky, given the rising house prices, that despite not doing anything to improve the value apart from sitting on it, the local neighbourhood has risen quite a lot, so it shouldn&#39;t be an issue for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/New-Design.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kitchen Design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the career front, I&#39;m not feeling that great. The Job is a struggle. I love my team and my peers, but there is a constant background from leadership ... not leading. If you&#39;re going to lead, you have to act and do things that empower your people - at the moment, it is the complete opposite of that. And if there is an opportunity for the operations team to move and get things done, it gets shut down. So rather than moving forward, we are spending extreme amounts of energy and capacity moving backwards — because despite the team&#39;s need to move forward, we are being dragged back into the old default ways of working — hierarchy, power dynamics, information asymmetry, whispers and favourites. I don&#39;t know if I feel this more than others because I&#39;m more aware of the issues, but I can&#39;t seem to move the needle on this. I have tried to communicate the issues and offer a ton of solutions, and yet there is zero engagement, let alone any acknowledgment. The culture is becoming more and more toxic around me, and while there is a desire just to put my head down and stay out of it, it&#39;s impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led to me having less energy to devote to my career other objectives. The job is just one part of all of this, my aim is to build up more aspects of my career beyond the job. And that&#39;s happening! I had a couple of real bright spots this month with a couple of people reaching out over LinkedIn to discuss my work and some web stats pointing to some intriguing engagements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had two fantastic conversations with learning design colleagues about the work I&#39;ve been doing around Learning Design Systems. They were great conversations and made me and the work I&#39;ve been doing feel valued (sometimes more so than The Job!).  I loved the fact that both conversations came from people stumbling across my work, finding &lt;a href=&quot;https://timklapdor.wordpress.com/2022/10/27/a-learning-design-system/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediaproduction.adelaide.edu.au/online-design-system/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt; that I&#39;ve worked on but never fully &amp;quot;finished&amp;quot;. It annoyed me as I did submit a paper to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ascilite.org/annual-conference/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ascilite&lt;/a&gt; last year, which Reviewer 2 didn&#39;t like, and so it didn&#39;t go through, and while I understand the system, it was disappointing. I didn&#39;t have the energy to push back on the decision or really look at resubmitting elsewhere, but I probably should have because it was an attempt to document the system as a whole. I think I might stick it &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/developing-a-learning-design-system/&quot;&gt;up on here on the blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other interesting find was the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning-patterns.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Learning Patterns&lt;/a&gt;. I turned on some basic web analytics to get a sense of engagement and saw a spike in visitors from Spain. Hmmmm, I wonder why? Looking through some of the logs I found this resource &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://view.genial.ly/65ce25578c35460014799729/interactive-content-retos-de-la-educacion-medica-planeacion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Challenges of medical education. Importance of planning&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. I don&#39;t speak any Spanish, but I love the fact that this exists and that the video demonstrates how easy it has become to translate something on the web these days — a click of a button in the browser and all of a sudden, my English site becomes natively Spanish! I hope they say good things in the video - but to be honest, I love the fact that this exists!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken from a bigger perspective, the career progresses well even if The Job is spluttering along!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthwise - things are OK. I&#39;m doing well on the walking and general activity. My Apple Watch informed me I was averaging 10km a day - so that&#39;s good. I need to work on getting to the gym more - adding an extra session or two would be great, but have found the balancing act of schedules hard to manage. Eating is OK too, but could certainly be better - this last week wasn&#39;t great with socialising, being out and Easter all happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Events&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went and saw Mr Bungle with Dave and Stu. It wasn&#39;t what I expected or anticipated - being basically a thrash metal gig rather than anything close to any from California. It had its merits, and it was good to see members of Slayer and Anthrax, as well as Mike Paton, strutting around the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms A and I also went to Womad on the Sunday. It was a stinking hot day, getting up into the 40s and so the struggle with the heat was very real. We saw Wildfire Manwurrk, Connie Bailey Rae, Witch, Dubioza Kolektiv (probably the first band that kicked it the day off as the sun was going down and they had a great selection of ska/gypsy/reggae and rap. Was great fun!)., Ibibo Sound Machine (great club funk sound) and Moonlight Benjamin - who were my pick of the day. We watched the whole set and it was mind-blowing! Described as a &amp;quot;voodoo queen priestess&amp;quot; Benjamin was truly amazing and captivating. I swear she was casting spells on stage and had the audience captivated. She had the perfect frontman persona, strutting on stage and working the audience. The rest of the band was great with a fantastic Vox driven raw and heavy blues rock sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clare and I celebrated our anniversary of being together - 24 years! Had a great meal out at Bandit in Unley and did the Feed Me Menu there (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@timklapdor/112121320240195957&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;not this one&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Photos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; data-footer=&quot;true&quot; data-context=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/timklapdor/53624342329/in/album-72177720314386151/&quot; title=&quot;Morning colours&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53624342329_13112a7466_b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; alt=&quot;Morning colours&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Watched&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got through a few different shows - but would recommend the following documentaries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love Has Won&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telemarketers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Listened&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still listening to a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fourstrokebaron.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Four Stroke Baron&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big month of podcasts this month and quite a few I would recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Behind the Bastards series on &lt;a href=&quot;https://omny.fm/shows/behind-the-bastards/part-one-the-terrible-secret-of-steve-jobs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Terrible Secret of Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt; is really well done and quite horrific. I have a real issue with hero worship and this is basically why - despite success in many areas, a lot of people are horrible in others. Their work isn&#39;t a reflection of their behaviour in other areas of their life. While Jobs can be lauded for his ability to shape the tech world he was also a stinky goblin and deadbeat and abusive Dad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001w206&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Gatekeepers&lt;/a&gt; is a really useful series on the history of social media and the discussion of them as gatekeepers. The series threads the historical perspectives of silicon valley and the narrative it has constructed for itself (challenging the powers that be while being very much of and for those same powers) and contrasts that with their &lt;em&gt;actual effects&lt;/em&gt; on societies. The Rest Of World episode is really important in this story but it is hard to go past the emotional trauma of The Vortex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I smashed through Season 2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pod.link/1592984136&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Things Fell Apart&lt;/a&gt; over a couple of days. I am a huge fan of Jon Ronson, and I love his foray into these butterfly effect stories that seek to trace back the origins of ripples we feel today. Highly recommend the series and I think I will need to listen again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ed Zitron has been doing the rounds in my feed this month. He was on the Steve Jobs series on BTB, also made an appearance on Tech Won&#39;t Save Us and has launched his own podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://omny.fm/shows/better-offline?cloudflare-language=en-US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Better Offline&lt;/a&gt;. My pick of the early episodes is &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+BGz69GfLgE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Rot Economy&lt;/a&gt;. The episode seems to be an attempt to mix a conversation and Ed&#39;s more scripted elements and doesn&#39;t quite work in that seamless flow - which might just be a teething problem in an early episode, but the topic is spot on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Read&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rot Economy episode of Ed Zitron&#39;s podcast led me to one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ez.substack.com/p/the-rot-economy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ed&#39;s blog posts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public and private investors, along with the markets themselves, have become entirely decoupled from the concept of what “good” business truly is, focusing on one metric — one &lt;em&gt;truly noxious&lt;/em&gt; metric — over all else: growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Growth” in this case is not necessarily about being “bigger” or “better,” it is simply “more.” It means that the company is generating more revenue, higher valuations, gaining more market share, and then finding more ways to generate these things. Businesses are expected to be - and rewarded for being - eternal burning engines of capital that create more and more shareholder value while, hopefully, providing a service to a customer in the process. In the public markets, that means that &lt;a href=&quot;https://ez.substack.com/p/techs-elite-hates-labor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; were rewarded for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/9daf27f6-dde7-40d8-b01d-33b70844aa69&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;having unfocused, capital-intensive businesses that required mass layoffs when times got tough&lt;/a&gt;, because the market loved the idea that they’d found a way to save money. They weren’t punished for their poor planning, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/thomas-koulopoulos/why-this-13-year-google-employee-says-google-can-no-longer-innovate.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;their stagnating products&lt;/a&gt;, their mismanagement of human capital, or their general lack of any real innovation because &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the numbers kept going up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis is pretty spot on and can be evidenced in a number of ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zuckerberg burnt through $10billion, didn&#39;t produce a product and remains in charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The massive variations in HR over the last few years where we see swings of up to 20% of their workforce being hired or fired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The on going degradation of services and products to the point we now have a new term — &amp;quot;enshitification&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of any real and meaningful innovation from Silicon Valley for the past decade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lack of real products from Silicon Valley - we&#39;ve actually gone beyond needing customers or delivering services - it&#39;s literally just the Ponzi scheme now - see Crypto!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>Job vs Career</title>

    <summary>I came to the realisation fairly late in life that your job is not your career. One can help support the other, but they are never one and the same.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started 2024 with a bit of time off to spend contemplating my current state, assessing it and starting to plan out the future. One of the big issues and points of conflict and dissatisfaction during 2023 was my job. I had to really dig into this idea and came to the realisation that it was my job that was making me unhappy — not my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That distinction — Job vs Career — wasn’t apparent before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Job had become all-consuming and demanding. Having some space and time away from it gave me a better perspective, especially since the two aren’t the same. They’re not even interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A career contains a multitude of jobs. Some of them are the ones you get paid for, but many of them aren’t. And that’s often where the confusion comes into play. The paid job begins to bleed into other areas, and you associate the paid job with all the other jobs. They get lumped together as a career, but they are distinct and need to be kept separate. It’s our mind that blends them together, so every so often, we need to pull focus, reevaluate and paint in the edges to make it clear what our jobs really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the selling points of the Focus Course is &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt;, both to see things more closely and direct our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reflection, I can say that for the last few years, I’ve paid too much attention to my paid job and not my career. I’ve allowed the job to expand beyond its parameters and edges to consume everything around it—my time, attention, and priorities. What I need to do, and what I plan to do in 2024, is to switch that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to focus on my &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;career&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, not my &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say I won’t be working or pulling my weight; what I’m saying is that my focus will be my &lt;strong&gt;career&lt;/strong&gt; and the multiple other jobs that make &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; up. The other jobs to be done are learning, writing, sharing, connecting, communicating, and organising - all the things that I need and want in my career that my job can’t provide.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>February 2024</title>
    <link href="https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/03-04-february-2024/"/>

    <summary>Second public journal post for 2024. Here&#39;s what happened in February.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h3&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So 2024 and a &#39;long&#39; February. I could feel the weight of that extra day 😁!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February kicked off with a return to work and the start of high school for my daughter. Ms A has adapted quickly to high school life, I wish I could say the same about work. It came as a bit of a shock, but one of the great things was that despite a couple of issues coming up while I was away, my team stepped in and solved them while I was away! So my inbox was reading through a bunch of email threads that began &amp;quot;Thanks for all your work on getting that resolved.&amp;quot; and me going back through the chain to find out WTF had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the weekly routine has been a challenge. I got very used to having lots of time to exercise and ponder the world around me. Exercising has mostly consisted of walking the dog in the morning daily, a weekday gym visit, maybe one on the weekend, and an extended hike on Saturday morning. This has aligned with my aims of exercising and getting out into nature - so I&#39;m really happy with how things have gone in that space. I&#39;d like to make more room for the gym, but getting to and from the office, cooking, and chores means there&#39;s not a lot of time and energy left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been commuting into the city on the train daily. This has been great as I&#39;m able to write on the way to work and do this every day. I think February has been my most prolific on the blog for ages, and I feel really good about it. I haven&#39;t got around to writing much about learning design, which is one of my goals, but every Saturday during my hike, I&#39;ve been taking voice notes and have been pulling a lot of scattered ideas together. Given that &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/i-don&#39;t-think-in-words/&quot;&gt;I don&amp;apos;t think in words&lt;/a&gt; this to me is progress. The words are coming; they&#39;re just not all there yet or as coherent as I&#39;d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been making roads towards my side hustle. I&#39;ve got a logo, domain and email setup – just need some content now! (If you read this and are curious - DM me, and we can chat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some shocking news from a colleague who had only recently left the team that their partner had died suddenly. It was a massive shock to myself and the team. I am flummoxed on what to do in the face of other people&#39;s grief as I know how private and personal that process is and needs to be. We can always share the loss, but not the grief - that&#39;s up to us to process, and we all do it differently. I gave to the GoFundMe that popped up as being interstate made it impossible to really do or contribute anything. I&#39;m deeply shocked and emotional about the family and the loss. Anyone losing a parent is a callback to my own experience of losing my dad and the ongoing pangs of grief and sadness that come with it. That mortal coil is a thing and we the fact we are here is always precarious, but damn we get our hooks into those around us and we get ripped apart when they go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the Focus Course, and you can read up on my notes and progress. I&#39;d happily recommend doing the course and have used a lot of the concepts back at work and I feel much more confident about life the universe and everything. And that&#39;s honestly where my vibe is at. Things are moving, and they are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Events&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s officially &lt;strong&gt;Mad March&lt;/strong&gt; here in Adelaide - where we cram in every possible cultural event into the last two weeks of February and three of March. The Fringe is on and I&#39;ve been to a couple of shows already. I&#39;ve got my ticket to WOMAD - just a day of the festival this year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Photos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/48074786@N06&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53564483153_2ae83ae7f8_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Watch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criminal Record on AppleTV - I enjoyed this series. Loved the play on sympathy and good vs. bad that was covered in the show. Great performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super Rugby - It&#39;s back! This is going to be the year of rebuilding Australian Rugby and this is where it all needs to start. There&#39;s already been turmoil with clubs on the verge of going bust and a threat to whole competition, but at the same time the game remains the same. Some great matchups coming and looking forward to what comes from this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Listened&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chameleon S07 The Michigan Plot - This is another one that questions the tactics of the FBI, but a bit more of a tangled mess. Dealing with a militia plot to kidnap a sitting governor, it&#39;s a captivating story full of bumbling fools, untouched bravado, bullshit and horrific casual threats of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark Net Diaries - Another great episode on &lt;a href=&quot;https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/92/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Pirate Bay&lt;/a&gt;. I loved the more philosophical elements of the discussion in the episode. I have always liked Peter Sunde and his coverage in the media. The way he tried to challenge the status quo was admirable, and I loved the discussion of the law in Sweden and the huge differences between it and the US legal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Read&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wheresyoured.at/sam-altman-fried/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Subprime Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; - Loved this piece from Ed Zitron. I cleared out a couple of posts from my drafts on AI this week as they&#39;d been bugging me. As soon as I hit publish then along comes Ed with this knock out piece. So many links and research - this is exactly what&#39;s needed around AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jenniferplusplus.com/losing-the-imitation-game/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Losing the imitation game&lt;/a&gt; - Another AI post, this time from Jennifer Moore. This is a great explainer about the hype and technical operations of AI that seems to get lost in the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Understanding and Meaning</title>
    <link href="https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/03-02-understanding-and-meaning/"/>
    <updated>2024-03-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/03-02-understanding-and-meaning/</id>
    <media:content

        type="image/jpeg" />
    <summary>Expanding on previous post a bit more to unpack what I think Understanding and Meaning have to do with our conversations around AI.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;So my &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/02-25-intelligence-requires-understanding-and-meaning/&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; got &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=76311&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Downes&#39;d&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, which is nice, but at the same time, Stephen&#39;s commentary can be challenging. In his brief commentary, he laid out his issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, sounds great, until you push a bit on what counts exactly as &#39;understanding&#39; and &#39;meaning&#39;. What is &#39;understanding&#39;? Knowledge of causal principles? Not robust enough. General laws and principles? Too inflexible. A model or world view? Sure, now we&#39;re getting closer. But that&#39;s what AIs do! Kids learning &#39;why&#39; - what sort of answer do you give them? Cause, principles, theory. Right? So what is there to &#39;understanding&#39; that AIs don&#39;t do. The same sort of questions arise around &#39;meaning&#39;. Do we mean &#39;intentionality&#39;? &#39;Intensionality?&#39; &amp;quot;emotions or tone&amp;quot; Aw, we &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; know AI can respond to these. It&#39;s too easy to simply say &amp;quot;understanding &amp;amp; meaning.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let me expand a little more, as I think it&#39;s useful to delve a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen provides a couple of options for framing understanding, but I&#39;d like to keep it simple. Understanding is not just the knowledge of a thing; you must also grasp its cause or explanation. It is a deeper sense of what the thing is, but also how it has come to be. It isn&#39;t just knowing the definition of the words but the context in which you would use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s apply that definition: The thing in the example of ChatGPT is text. Yes, it knows that object quite well and intimately. But it doesn&#39;t grasp cause or explanation. As I said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT didn&#39;t learn the topic, it did no research, it did no validation, and it contributed no novel thoughts, ideas or concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it can demonstrate &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; of a specific domain. A &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt; of that knowledge, yes. However, a model is not the same as understanding. The &#39;worldview&#39; this AI has isn&#39;t worldly, connected or contextual - it is within a specific domain. There is no connection to other models or concepts or bodies of knowledge or to the world it inhabits. Those are the elements that generate understanding. These particular models are purely mathematical - they are calculations of the most &lt;em&gt;probable&lt;/em&gt; correct answer. This is what Large Language Models do - calculate. They don&#39;t do anything else to achieve their end results - which can be impressive and look like intelligence created them - but that&#39;s not how they were achieved. The LLM never understood your request, it just performed a series of complex pattern matching and weighted the results to what calculated to the most correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding on the other hand, based on the definition about, would include triangulating that answer more broadly and across a broader area of knowledge, experience, connections, and contexts. It would also include coming back without an answer - or with additional questions and clarifications. Or not providing an answer if the context and what was asked was wrong or inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI, as it stands, has none of those features so it cannot understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to meaning, Stephen offers a couple more suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we mean &#39;intentionality&#39;? &#39;Intensionality?&#39; &amp;quot;emotions or tone&amp;quot;[?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, meaning has more to do with seeking an answer, asking why, and seeking to find out about the cause and effect and reason for things to occur. In that sense, it is about intentionality and less about the others. Seeking out and finding meaning is beyond an algorithms capability because it is not sentient, alive or intelligence. Stephen&#39;s next line illustrates that perfectly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aw, we &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; know AI can respond to these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; — exactly. It doesn&#39;t engage in making meaning, it can&#39;t because its just calculations, and even they have to be kicked off by an executable command.  There&#39;s also oodles of examples that show how badly generative tools can respond. They don&#39;t understand the meaning of math, humour, sarcasm, fingers, nuance or language as a vessel for emotion. But we can and do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&#39;t a single step in the algorithm that involves making meaning from what it outputs. It is pattern matching. It&#39;s good at that yes, but that is not making meaning. Readable, legible, spelling and grammar - they are patterns. Meaning is not. AI is just code — anything beyond that, and it is us creating (or buying in) the illusion. These are the parlour tricks I&#39;ve mentioned - it &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; intelligent, and if we &lt;em&gt;speak&lt;/em&gt; of it as intelligence, we lend credence to it being &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; of as intelligence. But it isn&#39;t. &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;It&#39;s just code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now look, I&#39;ll be honest - I&#39;m getting outside my comfort zone here. I don&#39;t have the background to jump into a philosophical debate around the different interpretations of meaning and understanding, as they seem like contested concepts across multiple disciplines. What I contend is that regardless of that nuance — what is being done by generative AI is not an example of intelligence. That all of the generative tools out there today do not represent anything intelligent. They don&#39;t function like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a huge amount of confusion about what &amp;quot;AI&amp;quot; does, how it does it, and what it &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to do. There is a mislabelling (which is intentional) to rebrand machine learning and other big data concepts as &amp;quot;intelligence&amp;quot;. By labelling this technology intelligence, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; perform the gestalt and apply the concepts that sit alongside it. We apply traits and behaviours that don&#39;t actually exist. By doing so we become part of the hallucination of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

She goes into the operations of AI, how an LLM works. I&#39;d already picked this up from my own research and experience, but I don&#39;t think I could have explained it as simply as she does.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>I’m curious - has anyone ever challenged the notion that Ticking a Box or pressing Accept has the same validity as a signature?</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m being spammed by a bunch of companies that are updating their &lt;strong&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/strong&gt;. These long legal documents have become the default for every web service as a self-made get-out-of-jail-free card. They tend to outline how they aren’t liable for any loss you would encounter, they’re not responsible for maintaining their services and your data, and any loss or damage you may encounter using THEIR service is YOUR problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are written in legalese, an impenetrable dialect of English full of loopholes, double meaning and antiquated terminology that only a minority of the population can decipher, usually only to the extent that an entirely contradictory point of view can be extracted from the same text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the presentation. These aren’t meant to be read. They’re usually hidden from view rather than presented to the user. They have no readability or accessibility features and usually lack basic formatting or stylistic elements like headings, indentation, etc. There’s also the microscopic font size and language used. Legalese obviously had no copy editors or understanding of their audience to present them with valid and useful information. There is only the kitchen sink - which will be hurled at you if anything goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m curious… how valid are these as legal documents?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean seriously, in an objective verdict-by-your-peers way. If you presented a terms of service document to a jury, would it be seen as valid? Yes, the words exonerate the companies, but don’t they have a duty of care? If they take your money, that is also contractual. So, can you sell a service and then deny or not deliver it because of a loophole you created?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I&#39;m interested in is the process of gaining agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But you signed it…” but did I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ve ever “signed” anything online. Despite the technical geniuses in Silicon Valley, I have yet to encounter any technology capable of capturing my signature - the physical act of me signing my name as authorisation and acceptance. Most lack anything like a pen to complete the task or the resolution that would allow anyone to meaningfully verify and compare signatures. Is clicking a button or ticking a box an adequate equivalent? No physicality, no unique identifier, no sense of authorisation. If a bot can do it, then it’s not really a signature, nor should it qualify as an equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d also question the timing of the “acceptance”. Most services require you to accept the TOS &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; you can even use the service. How can you make an informed decision without even having a chance to see the service or interact with it? You don’t buy a house, car, or a microwave without the ability to test it out, look around, press some buttons and see if it’s suitable. So, how can an online service justify requiring you to accept a legally binding document BEFORE you use it? How much legal weight are we willing to give the TOS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a quick FYI that I&#39;ve added my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/tos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>A second post venting some of my frustration with AI, the hype and the reality of it.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, here&#39;s my position: intelligence requires understanding &amp;amp; meaning. Therefore, if you want to call something intelligent, then it must be able to exhibit understanding and meaning. AI, as it stands, can exhibit neither, which leaves it as being &lt;em&gt;Artificial&lt;/em&gt;. Or &lt;em&gt;fake&lt;/em&gt; – which is technically correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am over the promises and hype behind AI. What&#39;s become abundantly clear to me over the last year is that it&#39;s ALL 👏 JUST 👏 HYPE 👏. To go around claiming that ChatGPT is AI is not only misleading, it&#39;s grossly overstating its capabilities. My prediction is that this overhyping will lead to the claims being challenged legally in the next 12 months &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/02-25-intelligence-requires-understanding-and-meaning/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For something to generate text without an understanding of what those words are or what they mean is not intelligence – it&#39;s a &lt;em&gt;forgery&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT didn&#39;t learn the topic, it did no research, it did no validation, and it contributed no novel thoughts, ideas or concepts. Other people did all of that already. ChatGPT just colonised all of that data - hovering it up without any permission or legal right to do so, just like all the great white guys of the past - and now it can Copy/Paste that information to you in a timely manner because it&#39;s spending $US700k a day on compute. These models don&#39;t know the meaning of the words they generated because they base their sequence on probability, not correctness. The words aren&#39;t checked for correctness or understanding, but comprehension based on similar blocks of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, but it generates new things!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it? On it its own? Does it just come up with entirely new and novel things without, say, a &lt;em&gt;prompt&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. You provided the prompt. You &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;had&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to provide the prompt, or nothing would have happened. You provided the creativity. You did the heavy lifting of thought by generating the prompt. What you outsourced was the labour. You &lt;em&gt;could have&lt;/em&gt; crafted the text yourself, but it would have taken effort. Instead, you outsourced your request to a server farm to process it based on the similarity of the words you were searching for in its colonised and stolen data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not intelligent; it&#39;s sophisticated — both the mathematics and the hardware on which they&#39;re running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that the equation doesn&#39;t seek to understand the text or find meaning in it. For it to work, it doesn&#39;t need to. Instead, it creates shapes and patterns in a mathematically definable format that it can use to compare and predict similarities and fit because, at some point, other people told it what was correct. It&#39;s had years of person-hours telling it where it went wrong and where it was right - we have that too – it&#39;s called childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, kids learn &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;. They don&#39;t just learn the patterns of behaviour; they learn the causes and effects. They develop an understanding not just of the shape, but the reason for it. They can understand and create meaning not just from the simple but from the complex. Good parenting, guardianship, and solid relationships do this, and it takes effort and time. It is very different to the behaviourist conditioning of &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/02-25-intelligence-requires-understanding-and-meaning/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; these models utilise. Children learn across modes, media, instances and locations, social and individual spaces, cultures, and languages. ChatGPT does none of that. It doesn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt;. It cannot relate to emotions or tone; it doesn&#39;t need to make relationships or maintain or grow them. It doesn&#39;t count what it doesn&#39;t need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It simply spits out words. Just words. Like Clippy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is just about words, but we see the same model being applied to other areas — image generation, voice cloning, videos, search, and soon-to-be every app you touch. They operate in the same mode - adapting pixels and bits based on training data they colonised and stole. And we feed them more data without question. Every app that comes out now is there to hoover up the next data set. Yesterday, they came for your words; now, they come for your prompts. Producing more forgeries along the way, and not just some dodgy text - but fake nudes, political lies, news reports, state propaganda, disinformation &amp;amp; misinformation – stuff that will have a real and tangible impact on the world, on you and your family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t buy into the hype or the &amp;quot;someday-isms&amp;quot;. Look at what&#39;s around today. Ask yourself - will AI do anything to fix this, or will it just make it worse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it help you connect with your kid or your partner?&lt;br /&gt;
Will it help with climate change or add to it?&lt;br /&gt;
Will it create more insidious spam?&lt;br /&gt;
Will it just add fuel to the fire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is — regardless of what we choose, all the worst things &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; happen. Maybe not to us, but every nightmare will happen somewhere in the world because this technology doesn&#39;t understand or mean anything. It doesn&#39;t understand the implications of what it creates. It doesn&#39;t know the meaning of the words or what the pixels in the image mean to someone - it just makes them happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than a superintelligence, we are creating a subprime idiot &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/02-25-intelligence-requires-understanding-and-meaning/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>I haven’t been a participant in the discussion around AI. I’ve preferred to sit back and watch the commotion and spend time with my thoughts about what&#39;s been going on.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;What I’ve noticed with every conversation about AI is the hype. The unbridled enthusiasm, constant media coverage and headline-grabbing are simply unavoidable. It is omnipresent in everything day to day, driving conversations, think pieces, reporting and &#39;thought leadership&#39; to an absolute saturation point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hype points to the undeniable financial underpinnings of this technology more than its actual capabilities. What is the groundbreaking evolution? Where is the evidence that this is revolutionary? All we have are parlour games, smoke, and mirrors. Passable text but never exceptional. Useful but never ready. Brilliant but unstable and untrustworthy. And with an increasing amount of terrible side effects - from more intrusive and &#39;customised&#39; spam through to fake nudes and reality-distorting media, all producible at pennies on the dollar on an unimaginable global scale. To be honest, these aren&#39;t the side effects - this is the product. Fakery on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the coverage is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I&#39;ve seen all this before. Multiple times. This is the hype machine in full force because what is at stake is not the future of mankind - but the price of stock. This is the Silicon Valley hype machine in full swing to drive an investment fever in order to prop up the latest tech Ponzi scheme designed to make VC firms another ungodly sum of money before the hype deflates, and we&#39;re left with yet another set of broken promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s go back to recent history in tech - big data and the blockchain. Remember them? They were going to revolutionise everything too. They were going to change how we operate as humans on the planet and free us from the tedium of work. It was going to be sunshine and rainbows for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they didn&#39;t deliver any of that. Instead, every government institution went and spent millions on bullshit infrastructure like a &#39;data lake&#39; to still have no idea about their customers, users and staff. They are still incapable of making an informed decision because data doesn&#39;t do that - people do, but we spent all the money on the lake, so now they don&#39;t decide. They don&#39;t function. This isn&#39;t just government. Every organisation has spent the last decade accumulating data to the point where they have normalised surveillance and destroyed any notion of privacy. And for what? The Likes? The Shares? The hits and impressions, the eyeballs and the attention. All of this has rolled into the world&#39;s biggest distraction — the planet is burning up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We became so distracted that we didn&#39;t even question the legitimacy and absolute lunacy of the blockchain. The &#39;trustless&#39; technology that worked out you can Ponzi scheme faster by removing people from the equation. Blockchain birthed the financial institution preferred by criminals and pedophiles the world over, which, as of February 2023,  requires the same amount of electricity as Australia to process just  0.11% of the world&#39;s economic transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hype is the game. The game is all just about money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product isn&#39;t the AI text of videos - it&#39;s our ability to hand over money to the already rich to allow them to get richer at ever-increasing speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It even has a price tag now - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-14/sam-altman-7-trillion-ai-bid-openai-chat-gpt/103460282&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;$US7 trillion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this was in my drafts this much richer post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wheresyoured.at/sam-altman-fried/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Subprime Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; from Ed Zitron was published.

    <summary>The Focus Course culminated in Margin Week, where we channelled our energy into creating margin in our lives.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Margin was the secret sauce that sold me on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/focus-course/&quot;&gt;Focus Course&lt;/a&gt; in the first place. Shaun discussed and posted about the flywheel of productivity, but also the negative counter-productive wheel as well. What I’d got out of a previous blog post was that I was certainly on one of these wheels, and it wasn’t the good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/flywheel.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flywheel of Pructivity outlining the steps of Identify, Plan, Act and Celebrate as well as it&#39;s inverse - Busywork, Reactive, Procrastination and Burnout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few years had slowly spiralled out of control, and I found myself lost in busywork, being completely reactive, prone to procrastination and having repeating bouts of burnout. I needed to change, and what was coming out of this course was some of the mechanisms to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were introduced to the &lt;strong&gt;7 Areas of Resistance&lt;/strong&gt;, which were set out as common impediments to change because they undermine our ability to focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inbox addiction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Urgency mindset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distractions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Counterfeit rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Busywork&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfectionism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inbox Addiction was a key one for me. This isn’t confined to email, but our tendency to check our online life and dip into the firehouse that is the modern social feed. I’ve become pretty dependent on my phone as a tool for distraction, scrolling around at every pause in daily life. This clip came up in one of those feeds somewhat surreptitiously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=476&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Freel%2F756032806384688%2F&amp;show_text=false&amp;width=267&amp;t=0&quot; width=&quot;267&quot; height=&quot;476&quot; style=&quot;border:none;overflow:hidden&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowFullScreen=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness. Yeah I guess that’s what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Urgency Mindset was in regards to prioritising &lt;strong&gt;urgent&lt;/strong&gt; over &lt;strong&gt;essential&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a behaviour that I have grown into and with sober expense when it comes to my health and wellbeing. I’ve struggled with getting my priorities right, more so my decision making when it comes to my priorities. Essential are things like exercise, family time, relationships and networks, but not giving them the attention they deserve because of whatever is on fire or due tomorrow is not good. I need to address this better this year and have started to mark out some key boundaries at work and set some more realistic expectations for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest the whole list applies to my life at the moment and it’s why I’m here! Out of the remaining items I found the idea of Counterfeit Rest quite interesting. True rest is the kind of activity that &lt;strong&gt;give&lt;/strong&gt; you energy rather than take it. I’d actually started to think about this a bit earlier having read something similar. At the end of most work days my brain felt like it was fried and so rest became a mixture of scrolling on my phone and watching shit TV. It didn’t make me feel more rested, in fact it probably made me more tired and more distracted. All I was doing was adding more inputs into my already stretched brain. More inputs, more options, more choices = more distractions. But if I spent the same time playing guitar or writing some code or editing photos, or writing – then I felt better. I felt that even though I&#39;d given something of myself, more had come back in return. Rest wasn&#39;t just about sleep, but a more holistic practice of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recharge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Given our electric lives I think we spend more time and effort ensuring our devices can recharge more than ourselves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area of my life needs some more work. There is a lot of solidly built up habits that revolve around my phone and I need to break that habit, but I need to come up with some better practices. This is on my to-do list and I&#39;ll probably write up something if I find some that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next exercise got us to jump into our Urgency Mindset. I really liked this quote from Stephen Covey included in the workbook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urgency addiction is a self-destructive behavior that temporarily fills the void created by unmet needs. And instead of meeting these needs, the tools and approaches of time management often feed the addiction. They keep us focused on daily prioritization of the urgent. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to realize that urgency itself is not the problem. The problem is that when urgency is the dominant factor in our lives, importance isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept of &lt;strong&gt;urgent&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;essential&lt;/strong&gt; was really clarifying for me. The definitions used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urgency is usually defined by &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;external&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that are essential are fundamentally important, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;regardless&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of external factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways the simplicity of this is to focus on the meaningful aspects of life — your health, wellbeing, family and relationships - as these are essential to life. Everything else isn&#39;t as important because its not essential to our lives. We can argue that our jobs are, but in reality work might be or an income, but not our jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urgency, therefore is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;relative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; while essential is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;absolute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it was on to Margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margin is breathing room.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s the opposite of overload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea of space and capacity is central to the concept of margin, and to be honest, I could feel that. At work, I felt like I was sprinting all the time, but the race I was in was a marathon. This meant fatigue and burnout were not just inevitable, they were guaranteed. Without space to rest and recover, I was going to degrade over time. It was already happening. My health wasn&#39;t great, my family time had been distracted, and my ability to care had been challenged. There wasn&#39;t space for everything, so I was pushing out the essentials and had replaced them with the urgent. I needed to change that around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning around Margin itself was essentially&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margin is the space between our load and our limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This required a bit of unpacking from my perspective. I couldn&#39;t tell you what my baseline load was, nor my limits. For years I&#39;ve just been operating without thinking. Working in a field with knowledge rather than physical labour, finding and accepting those limits was challenging. I have a drive to do more, to do it better – but I can&#39;t do everything, and that&#39;s the only limit I&#39;d found – not everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this wasn&#39;t sustainable and bordered on the absolutely ridiculous. There were hard limits if I looked. One was simply what I got paid for – there are only so many hours in a week that I get paid for, so all work has to fit into them. If it doesn&#39;t, then it&#39;s not my problem to solve. I needed to prioritise what was important at work, what were the essentials vs the nice to haves. Completing my timetable in the habits week helped me deal with the biggest constraint in life — time. There&#39;s no way to create more of - just to spend less time in specific areas. Time wasn&#39;t the only area, though; there were a couple of other areas in life that needed margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creative/Mental&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next challenge was to create margin in each area in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing our capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decreasing our load.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing our capacity essentially was around ways to raise our limits and how much we can take on. We could do that through a number of practices such as intentionality, routine, deep work, discipline, saving and strengthening. Decreasing our load was looking at ways we could automate, eliminate, delegate, set boundaries, have self-control and focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for each area that&#39;s what we did - come up with a way increase our capacity and decrease our load. Doing this we would restore margin into our lives (or at least craft a path to do so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for me I chose the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Time&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;↑ planning the week and month ahead&lt;br /&gt;
↓ creating clear boundaries at work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Finances&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;↑ create some new income streams&lt;br /&gt;
↓ spend less - no new big expenses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Emotions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;↑ more time outside with family&lt;br /&gt;
↓ less time wasted scrolling around feeds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Creative&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;↑ switch off my devices and find a flow state&lt;br /&gt;
↓ less time wasted scrolling around feeds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Health&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;↑ more exercise and physical activity&lt;br /&gt;
↓ less bad food&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might notice a bit of a double-up on the scrolling around - but I feel that insidious behaviour is impacting a couple of key areas of my life and that it&#39;s taking up too much of my attention (despite the fact I do it to escape!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Focus Declaration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final part of the course was filling out our &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus Declaration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The statement drew on a bunch of the activities we had completed during the course and summarised what we achieved. So here is mine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I value &lt;strong&gt;understanding&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;independence&lt;/strong&gt;, I want to focus on my &lt;strong&gt;career&lt;/strong&gt; and begin moving toward my desired outcome of &lt;strong&gt;being able to have a choice in the work I do&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that small, consistent steps can result in big change. Thus, I will begin to make time in my schedule for &lt;strong&gt;developing a side hustle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to protect my ability to focus, I will work to restore and maintain margin in my &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt;, by &lt;strong&gt;planning the week and month ahead&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;creating boundaries at work&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signed&lt;br /&gt;
TIM KLAPDOR 17/2/2024&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a little longer to finalise the last week and return to my Focus Declaration, but I actually appreciated the extra time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the end — would I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefocuscourse.com/Course/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Focus Course&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, 100%. I&#39;ve started to use a lot of the techniques in other areas of my life, and I&#39;ve come back to my notes on numerous occasions. I feel better about work and life. I&#39;ve made peace with some critical aspects of my job and have really enjoyed embedding some of my habits. I still need to break my phone addiction, but at the same time, the device has let me complete a few of my habits. While I&#39;m yet to publish much on learning design, I have been writing and creating words (via text-to-speech) using my phone. I&#39;ve found the commute to be incredibly productive as I&#39;ve shifted to taking the train every day rather than driving. Increasing my outputs rather than my inputs is my happy place, and I feel like I&#39;ve got traction and am moving in the right direction. I actually feel like I have a focus that I haven&#39;t had in years — not just on the everyday, but on the bigger picture too. I know more about what I want out of life and what I want to achieve, which feels empowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, do &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefocuscourse.com/Course/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the course&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Habits Week</title>

    <summary>Habits Week was all about — Habits! It focuses on the activities and actions we do, what we spend our time on and where we focus our attention.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/focus-course/&quot;&gt;Focus Course&lt;/a&gt; started with a list of any current habits or routines we had - both positive and negative. I had some good routines at work with my team, which I&#39;d developed and worked on to establish and set them up. Some of my chores had a rhythm - being the cook for the household helps. Getting our dog made daily exercise a strong habit; without it, he would go mental and take us with him! But apart from those, I found I had a lack of positive habits. There were many negative ones – getting on the phone, not planning anything for the weekends, mindless scrolling, playing time-eating games. These were often focussed around escape - trying to get away from work or the mounting chores and tasks at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to develop ideas for habits, routines, systems, and activities across the &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/6-areas-of-life/&quot;&gt;6 Areas of Life&lt;/a&gt;. This was really about how to align these with our own vision and values. The next step was to pick those up and pick a single activity for each area and map out the required time commitment and frequency of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having gone through the previous weeks and become much more aware of my goals I actually found this to be much easier than I expected. So my habits that I wanted to add in were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spiritual &amp;amp; Inner = &lt;strong&gt;Nature Time&lt;/strong&gt; of 2 hours and to do this weekly. This activity will move me toward my inner personal goal of connecting to place because it&#39;s time away from screens. It is time to engage with beauty and feel the weather.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical Health = &lt;strong&gt;Hard Sweat&lt;/strong&gt; for 1 hour a week. This activity will move me toward my physical health goal of feeling confident to take on more challenging activities because it will push me harder, and I earn rewards from the effort and a feeling of achievement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relationships = &lt;strong&gt;Phone a Friend&lt;/strong&gt; for 1 hour a week. This activity will move me toward my relationship goal of connecting with people because I will actively connect with old (and new) friends and build regularity of catching up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest and Recreation = &lt;strong&gt;Plan the Week&lt;/strong&gt; for 1 hour a week. This activity will move me toward my rest and recreation goal of taking time for me to create margin and space because I need to be conscious of my time and make better use of it — not treading water or being reactive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career = &lt;strong&gt;Write and Publish about Learning Design&lt;/strong&gt; for 2 hours a week. This activity will move me toward my career goal of creating value and a reputation because it helps create business opportunities and a sense of giving and fulfilment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finances = &lt;strong&gt;Side Hustle&lt;/strong&gt; spending about 3 hours a week. This activity will move me toward my financial goal of starting a new business because every step towards this goal gets me there faster and will make me feel more in control of my finances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was putting them on a weekly planner and seeing how that would all work. There were a few things I went and added to my planner so as not to make this idealistic - but something that would be possible to do. So I included my work hours, commuting, walking the dog, chores and cooking time, and some other areas of life I felt were missing from my schedule - family time and date night. It&#39;s not that I&#39;d miss those, but I wanted to include them on my schedule as &lt;em&gt;things I need to do&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so I didn&#39;t get around to writing this up straight away. It&#39;s been about three weeks, and I&#39;ve been living the schedule, and it&#39;s working! I&#39;ve managed to follow it. Getting to the gym has been challenging since coming back to work, but my work schedule has been pretty up and down, and we&#39;re getting into a bit of a flow with the new family schedule too. What I&#39;ve noticed is that the general pattern of life feels good, not overwhelming. I&#39;ve had time to myself and have been progressing toward all of my goals which is a great feeling. The habits are working!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Broken Streak</title>
    <link href="https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/02-12-broken-streak/"/>

    <summary>On Friday I broke my streak. I forgot to complete the daily mini-puzzle in Knotwords and ended a 92-day streak.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I also didn’t close my green circle - the exercise ring on the Apple Watch. I was pretty tired by the end of the week as the new work schedule kicked in. The dog had a play date so my regular exercise didn&#39;t quite happen. I went to bed early, and right as I was heading off to brush my teeth, I looked down, and my exercise ring wasn&#39;t quite closed. I could have put on my shoes and headed out around the block and closed that damn circle, but I didn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/streak.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Gap in My Streak&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, I&#39;d think that this was a failure, but to be honest, I&#39;d forgotten to rest. In all my planning and trying to be more focused on the future, it&#39;s all been about doing things and getting things done. I keep pushing down rest as being idle as wasteful, but it&#39;s something I have to be more conscious of and pay attention to. I think I need to schedule rest and idle time just to add buffer and recovery to my habits. Rather than ignore it, it’s more about making space for it - to be conscious of it and that it is a rational need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also made me think about the gamification trap many of us have fallen into. Some of that data is really good and motivating. Those streaks have helped move my inactive body into an active one. I&#39;m seeing results from the health data from the changes I&#39;ve made to diet and exercise. They help quantify change. They also don&#39;t tell our story. They don&#39;t understand the long haul flights or travelling, illnesses or sick kids that mean exercise isn&#39;t even an option. I appreciate the prompts sometimes; they help chores become habits, but they lack nuance and awareness, which, if they were truly &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot;, they would understand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dualities</title>

    <summary>There is something about complexity that excites me. That lack of the obvious, elements which are hidden and unrevealed, and how things are interconnected sparks my intellectual curiosity.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Music is a big area of this curiosity and expression. I am drawn to the more complex music and often find myself drawn to hybrids and fusions of styles, tastes and sensibilities. I grew up playing metal throughout my teenage years, which in and of itself plays into the nature of dualities. Here is a whole genre that toys with dualities - of being brutal and beautiful, emotive and reflective, layered and simple, funny and hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently came across Four Stroke Baron via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;r/progmetal&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit. They play a heady mix of heavy progressive metal and new-wave sound that is quite unique. I&#39;ve had their songs on repeat for a lot of this year so far, coming back to the haunting sonic scape of [Cyborg Pt.II: The City](&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/7scFocWRan0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/7scFocWRan0&lt;/a&gt; for another hit again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I was poking around online and came across the film clip for another song Sundowner. The 3rd person point of view clips are great (I was blown away the first time I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXs8XwHGuWg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lok står när de andra faller&lt;/a&gt;). What I love about this Sundowner is how it captures this clip captures the duality of the song. There is the fun and joy of the opening riff and vocal line, but the song soars and changes throughout. It descends and rises, is dark and joyful - and the transition between these dualities is beautifully captured in this tiny transition in the first minute of the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/r273IbLr99BCduXbxw&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowFullScreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/gifs/sundowner-fourstrokebaron-r273IbLr99BCduXbxw&quot;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love these little moments in songs and film, and this little clip gives me such joy. The ability to transport you between time and place, space and emotion is jarring and the shock is like a little shot of adrenaline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can enjoy the rest of the song here:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>January 2024</title>
    <link href="https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/02-01-january-2024/"/>
    <updated>2024-02-01T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <summary>My first public journal post for 2024. I&#39;m going to try this out as a monthly thing - so far not many attempts or formats have stuck! We live and learn and I&#39;ll keep trying to find something that sticks.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h3&gt;The Vibe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vibe has been chilled. I&#39;ve had pretty much all of January off from work, which has provided some much-needed rest and space to think. It&#39;s been a staycation - half planned, half because of circumstances (wife with COVID and some financial constraints). At the end of 2023, I was probably heading towards another burnout. I think I had two episodes in that year alone, but this time, I recognised the signs and, with my leave approaching, was able to switch off and not go down that path. Christmas away with family was a quick defuse of the situation, but I felt that I wasn&#39;t really present for my family during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January kicked off back at home — with a plan to eat better, exercise and get my shit together. Part of getting my shit together was enrolling in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefocuscourse.com/Course/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Focus Course&lt;/a&gt;. I came across the course via a blog post earlier in the year that discussed the busted flywheel that leads to burnout -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/symptoms-of-busted-productivity.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really resonated with where I&#39;ve been at work for the last year, but maybe longer. It does describe where I get to in terms of work and life at my lowest points. I don&#39;t suffer from depression - but this flywheel perfectly describes me at my worst. It&#39;s great being able to recognise something, but I needed to make changes. With two weeks of the focus course complete I have gone back to look at my core values, articulated a vision for my life that I feel good about, and started to work on some goals. This all ties in to making some changes to diet and exercise and I feel much more mentally prepared for the new year. The sense of impending burnout has gone and now I feel more focussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still two weeks of the course left, so there is plenty more to do, but my next big step is to feel more practised. To embed the changes into my everyday life. The challenge comes from going back to work and school and the drumbeat of the everyday returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the gym has been good. I do enjoy doing something more physically engaging and feeling better connected to my body - which often feels more like a flesh suit my brain is wearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I have been thinking through and working on has been to create a side hustle, something that I can challenge myself with but also open up some new possibilities. I&#39;ve spent the last 7 years working on designing better learning experiences and I&#39;ve created a bunch of resources and processes to do that. My plan is to build on that over the year and create some opportunities to share that. I&#39;m hoping to have a starting point up online in the next month... so keep an eye out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Photos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of my favourite snaps from the month.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; data-footer=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/timklapdor/albums/72177720314386151&quot; title=&quot;2024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53492461793_0b2ce46b3d_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; alt=&quot;2024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on what I&#39;ve been watching, reading and listening to I&#39;d recommend the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Watch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland&lt;/strong&gt; - A harrowing documentary told through historical footage and interviews. It reminded me of lunchtimes I had while working up in the north of Ireland and living in Derry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/z7DuvWVazpk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;fascinating video&lt;/a&gt; on Australian vowel sounds. A lot of the technical stuff is over my head, but I love that you can accurately describe these very nuanced aspects of language and sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binged on &lt;strong&gt;The Bear&lt;/strong&gt; S01 and S02. It&#39;s an interesting mix of themes and vibes, it has a &#39;feel good&#39; tone while dealing with really traumatic themes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beef&lt;/strong&gt; – Interesting story, great characters and premise. I loved the final episode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Bates vs. The Post Office&lt;/strong&gt; was an interesting portrayal of events in the British Postal System where Post Masters were blamed and held liable for software accounting errors. I can see a lot of similarities with Robodebt - and also what the next round of AI applications will be like. We have been warned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O.J. Made in America&lt;/strong&gt; I made it to E04, the courtroom episode, which was the first time I&#39;d seen the crime scene photos and been exposed to the DNA evidence. That was a horrific murder, and he got away with something terrible. The courtroom events were made for the tabloid media, and shockingly, it was allowed to take place. The final episode is wild. OJ fell off the radar here in Australia and his ending was not something I recall hearing anything about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Bird&lt;/strong&gt; - amazing series on Apple TV+. Truly great acting and storylines that run the gauntlet between deeply humanising and horrific and terrifying. The power of contrast is used perfectly throughout the series, balancing out the horrific and the beautiful. The pick of the series is The Place I Lie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Listen&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://darknetdiaries.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Darknet Diaries&lt;/a&gt; - binged this podcast series on cyber attacks and defence. There are lots of really good stories explaining professional skills in more depth, and this matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Read&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://robinrendle.com/the-cascade/012-design-systems-burnout/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Design Systems Burnout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article was a nice framing of the idea of systems work. I understand the feeling here about working in a system and the feeling of burnout. But I liked the two articles linked out - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jackcheng.com/sunday/414-all-work-is-care-work/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;All Work is Care Work&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/unified-theory-of------&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;A unified theory of fucks&lt;/a&gt; and I can relate to those connections. The reasons for systems work is &lt;strong&gt;care at scale&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than care as a one-to-one specialised commodity, can we provide greater independence and self reliance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jackcheng.com/sunday/414-all-work-is-care-work/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;All Work is Care Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to call this piece out on its own for its message about work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All work is care work. Not a statement of fact, more an outlook, a mindset. What if you asked, of your tasks and projects, “For whom am I caring?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer can be yourself. That’s a valid answer. It’s often &lt;em&gt;not only&lt;/em&gt; yourself but yourself and another – or more than one another. The reader of the published article or book. The neighborhood. The future children and grandchildren and/or your childhood self. The forest, the planet, all things living.&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
 Maybe true care, even when directed, turns out to be warmly concentric. By caring for one &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt;, you’re also caring for many other whoms. Maybe true care has no hard edges; it radiates outward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/unified-theory-of------&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;A unified theory of fucks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both above articles referenced this piece by Mandy Brown. This is great on a couple of fronts. I liked this description of burnout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to tell this story, about my theory of fucks. The theory goes like so: you are born with so many fucks to give. However many you’ve got is all there is; they are like eggs, that way. Some of us are born with quite a lot, some with less, but none of us knows how many we have. When we’re young, we go around giving a fuck about all kinds of things, blissfully unaware of our ever-dwindling supply. Until one day, we give the last fuck we’ve got, and we notice that the invisible bag of fucks we’ve been carrying around all these years is finally, irredeemably, empty. We have no more fucks left to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I liked this more hopeful and engaging description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my answers to the question of, why give a fuck about work? Why &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; your work? It won’t, of course, love you back. It can’t. Work isn’t a thing that can love. It isn’t alive, it isn’t and won’t ever be &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt;. And my answer is: &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t give a fuck about your work. &lt;em&gt;Give all your fucks to the living&lt;/em&gt;. Give a fuck about the people you work with, and the people who receive your work—the people who use the tools and products and systems or, more often than not, are used by them. Give a fuck about the land and the sea, all the living things that are used or used up by the work, that are abandoned or displaced by it, or—if we’re lucky, if we’re persistent and brave and willing—are cared for through the work. Give a fuck about yourself, about your own wild and tender spirit, about your peace and especially about your art. Give every last fuck you have to living things with beating hearts and breathing lungs and open eyes, with chloroplasts and mycelia and water-seeking roots, with wings and hands and leaves. Give like every fuck might be your last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because here’s what I’ve learned: if you give your fucks to the unliving—if you plant those fucks in institutions or systems or platforms or, gods forbid, interest rates—you will run out of fucks. One day you will reach into that bag and your hand will meet nothing but air and you will be bereft. You will realize the loss of something you did not know you ever had. But if you give a fuck about the living, about all your living kin in all the kingdoms, &lt;em&gt;they will give a fuck right back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in and around systems fucks get lost in the system, but there is value in the system if it is about the living. Focus the system on empowering those it touches, that will earn you fucks!&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>A summary of week 2 of the Focus Course.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Strategy Week in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/focus-course/&quot;&gt;Focus Course&lt;/a&gt; was all about manifesting our &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/01-28-vision-week/&quot;&gt;vision and values&lt;/a&gt;. We started out with an introduction to the &lt;strong&gt;8 Laws of Focus&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boundaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ownership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sowing and Reaping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tradeoffs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These made a lot of sense, each one describing a way of bringing things into focus, like whatever the machine is at the optometrists that swaps lenses in and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then went into the &lt;strong&gt;6 Areas of Your Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical Health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inner-Personal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest &amp;amp; Recreation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These areas often overlap; what happens in one space affects another, and one goal can help achieve another. The big aim of the week was to take each area and develop goals for different time spans - someday, 5 years, 1 year, 1 month, 1 week and today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was some big thinking, but I felt prepared for it. Mrs K and I had a habit of doing 5 years plans when we were younger. We joked that they always needed to be rewritten every 3 years as we made some dramatic decision that would uproot our lives. We haven&#39;t done that for a long time though. Once you have a partner, house, child and steady job, there is a tendency to stay that way and not be adventurous. For a while, that was good enough, particularly as we dealt with the trauma of &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/the-fire/&quot;&gt;The Fire&lt;/a&gt;. Moving to Adelaide was a big move, and then COVID hit, and I am only realising again how traumatic that was. We lived off adrenalin and cortisol for two years, waiting for family to die whilst being at our most remote and distant. We were forced to retreat and disconnect and be unable to connect with anyone new right when we arrived in a place where we knew nobody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was time for some goals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I jumped the gun on this a little. I had started thinking about this before I really started this week in the course. During my thinking time hiking through the bush, as I pondered values and vision, I also started to think about goals. We have a house (well, a mortgage, at least) - what&#39;s next? I have a decent-paying job - so what comes next? In the next 5 years, where will we be as a family? How different will our situation be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having my values and vision made this task a lot easier, and I really liked working in those different timeframes. It was thought-provoking, but that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. I was able to marry my vision to some clear goals and get some of that clarity and focus I&#39;ve been missing in my life across all six areas without too much hassle. For the first time in a long while, I feel like I made progress rather than just treading water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not going to share everything, but I think my Someday Goals act as a guide to how I&#39;m thinking about the future and how that sits with my values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Area&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Someday Goal&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;1. Career&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Work is optional and I have a choice about it. Rather than dominate life, it becomes an auxiliary function.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;2. Relationships&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Maintain a strong family bond with both sides. Have friends to share travel and adventures.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;3. Physical Health&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;To take better care of my body and embody my physical self.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;4. Inner-Personal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;To find a sustainable connection to people and place.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;5. Finances&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No mortgage or debts. To have a haven - a place to go for refuge and safety.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;6. Rest &amp;amp; Recreation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;To feel I have the energy and capacity to give and be able to choose when and what to give.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They provide a bit to play with in the other timeframes, but I was able to flesh out actionable and achievable goals for each area, which I&#39;m happy about and can work towards feeling better clarity around why I&#39;m doing what I&#39;m doing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Pulling together some thoughts on my weeks of study completing the Focus Course.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am writing up a brief reflection for each week of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/focus-course/&quot;&gt;Focus Course&lt;/a&gt;. Week 1 was Vision Week, and I was keen to jump straight in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were first introduced to the &lt;strong&gt;5 Components of a Focused Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life Vision - Why&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goals - What&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action Plan - How&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedule - When&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Habits - System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a flow mapped from each item to the next (1st to 5th), and it&#39;s suggested that if there is a specific problem with one of these components, it&#39;s best to go upstream and find the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This posed a pretty big problem for me... I&#39;d never considered having a Life Vision. Or perhaps what&#39;s more likely is that the key milestones and goals that I set early on in life I&#39;d achieved, and I haven&#39;t ever gone back to revisit those goals. So, I was pretty quickly having an existential crisis! Why am I here? What the fuck am I doing? That was kind of the point of doing the course right - to diagnose what I needed to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So of I went with my trusty dog by my side to hike through the hills and ponder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is my life vision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the work for the week was to develop your personal values, so I worked through each of the activities, which provided some guidance and asked the right kind of questions, but at the end of the workbook, I wasn&#39;t satisfied. It just didn&#39;t sit correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d tried to cheat a little and use the personal values I&#39;d come up with two years ago during a team building exercise which I repeated midyear in 2023. They felt current and correct then, but then again a lot had changed both at work and at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it was back to the drawing board. My original values were &lt;strong&gt;Understanding&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Accountability&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding still felt correct. It summed up my holistic drive to understand, to learn, be curious, have empathy, be creative and accepting of others. This felt true to the point where I could feel it in my bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accountability was where the problem was. I think this stemmed from a time and place and a frustration with the lack of accountability at work, in politics, in society — I had figured if I felt so deeply about it, it must be a value I hold true to. In many ways it is, but it doesn&#39;t capture why... why does accountability matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned to the list I had floating around (I&#39;d created a spreadsheet and used scores to shortlist before!). What I wanted was something that was more encompassing of multiple ideals. I was originally leaning towards authenticity, but that wasn&#39;t me; it was almost more of an ask for others. I respect truthful, honest, and authentic people, and I want to be around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I looked back at times I felt good, happy and challenged positively — and I think it comes back to feeling &lt;strong&gt;Independent&lt;/strong&gt;. Having autonomy and being able to be true to myself, honest and open. There is a self-reliance and survival component to it, but I think I also understand the need for help and aid that is required to gain independence — it is something that is worked for and earned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My two values of &lt;strong&gt;Understanding&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Independence&lt;/strong&gt; felt better. They felt right. And so with that, I went back to the tasks, and while I didn&#39;t have to change much - things felt much more aligned than before. With my value in place I could go back to my Vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course provided a simple template for this, drawing on a number of the activities in the workbook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In my roles as a ———, I want to express, impart and exemplify the values of ———, by ‚———.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was fine for a draft, but I wanted to make a vision a bit more personal to give it a bit more spice and flavour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is complex, but I want to seek to understand it. That means moving, changing and being dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is experiential. I want to see the world — walk it, taste it, see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be accountable for my actions and seek to tread softly and make choices that are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want the world to learn, starting with myself, then my family and those I can touch. Through learning, I can create opportunities for understanding, compassion and friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I want to have independence and help others achieve it so that we can live openly and honestly, being true to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being so zoomed out was such a release and a great way for me to get into that headspace. I was lucky I had the house to myself for most of the week and the time to really indulge in thinking. This summary overlooks a lot of the time and self-doubt I experienced during the week. In the end, it was worth it, and I celebrated with a cold beer on the deck.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Managerial Solutions</title>
    <link href="https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/01-16-managerial-solutions/"/>

    <summary>The role of a manager seems like an odd one. Why are they here? And by extension, why am I here? What exactly does a manager do? What can they actually do?</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;During one of my many meetings, I pondered,  &amp;quot;What exactly do I do?&amp;quot;. How limited are my actions in this process? I decided to write down what actions I am able to actually implement and came up with this short list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debate&lt;/strong&gt; - bring people together to resolve conflicts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delete&lt;/strong&gt; - remove the task, it&#39;s not going to happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegate&lt;/strong&gt; - apply someone else to the task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay&lt;/strong&gt; - push back the task to a later date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defer&lt;/strong&gt; - put the task on hold until it is required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double down&lt;/strong&gt; - add extra resourcing to ensure that it gets done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diminish&lt;/strong&gt; - reduce the scope of the task to something that will actually be completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this list diminishes the role of &lt;strong&gt;experience&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;context awareness&lt;/strong&gt;, as these play a vital role in taking the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; actions, but nonetheless, the possible actions of the manager are very limited. I think this is why being a manager so often feels unfulfilling and can be frustrating. There isn&#39;t a lot of creativity possible within these constraints. Because of that limitation, it&#39;s not very attractive to those with the right experience or context awareness - and this is what breeds managerialism - where those with limited experience and context take on manager roles and proceed to make poor decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Rather than making resolutions — although there are a few key areas of life I need to resolve and work on — I thought I&#39;d plan some dos and don&#39;ts instead.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is to lay out the behaviours I want to see from myself and acknowledge the less desirable ones, as well as a way of checking myself against falling down a rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Dos&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Don’ts&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Develop a sustainable routine and rhythm to the week.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lurch from one thing to the next like a drunk maniac.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sweat every day. I need to work on my fitness and consistently.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Use the weather as an excuse. Match the activity to the weather, one is out of your control.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Focus on career development. Work towards the future.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Focus less on my current job. It’s fine, and you’re already good at it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Move away from the drama. Start to call it out, but don’t buy into it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Get sucked into the drama vortex. Face what’s in front of me not the periphery.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Stop talking, start doing. Start making things happen. &lt;em&gt;Make the future&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Stop over thinking and wishful thinking.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;More food prep. Take the stress out of cooking and make life easier.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The carbs. This is the default solution for a lack of preparation, but it’s not helping at all.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Be more social. Make more effort to go out, to call people and reconnect with friendships.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isolate yourself. I recognise the trauma of COVID and the reaction to seal myself off, but it&#39;s not healthy.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Connect. Find the others. Get out of my shell and meet more people, build a network, find a way.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fall back to what was. That&#39;s still there, but there&#39;s a need to push forward now.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <summary>A bit of a summary of the build of this site and how it works.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;So here it is — version 1.0!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been keen to get &lt;strong&gt;Heart Soul Machine&lt;/strong&gt; up and running for a while now. I&#39;ve put it off for ages, wanting time and space to get it all perfect in my head. That lack of action prompted me to just go ahead and build it. Perfection is the enemy of good. 100% of nothing is zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a space for me, not everyone else. I wanted to create somewhere beyond the performant nature of social media. Somewhere social and connected, but my own space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it might be useful to go into a little bit about what is happening behind the scenes of HSM - what is the machine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;11ty&lt;/a&gt; a javascript based &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;static site generator&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;em&gt;SSG&lt;/em&gt;. An SSG essentially outputs your entire website as static HTML pages. This means you don&#39;t need to run a special web server or maintain a database. I create the content as Markdown files, build out the templates I want and the SSG smooshes them together. I just use the command line to &lt;code&gt;BUILD&lt;/code&gt;, and it outputs a folder full of files I can deploy anywhere. What the SSG does best is allow me to use some basic programming like &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/if-this-then-that/&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; style statements to create extra functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m currently hosting the site on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve been a customer of GitHub for quite a while, and while it&#39;s been bought by Micro$oft it&#39;s still performant and provides me what I need. The beauty of a SSG is that the actual files live on my computer. I can back them up and put the site up on any number of services — so I have flexibility built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve tried to do some new things with 11ty, SVGs, HTML and CSS during the build. For that end I&#39;ve packaged up a few things into the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-time-to-read#speed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;eleventy-plugin-time-to-read&lt;/a&gt; - Adds the handy reading time estimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/rss/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;eleventy-plugin-rss&lt;/a&gt; - Added the default RSS plugin. I&#39;ve previously made my own, but XML sucks, and this was a 5-minute job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/kevinweber/pen/dXWoRw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;SVG Factory&lt;/a&gt; - I borrowed this from Kevin Weber a while ago, and I use it and SCSS to create all the icons you see around the site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@photogabble/eleventy-plugin-interlinker&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Eleventy.js Interlink Plugin&lt;/a&gt; - I&#39;m an &lt;a href=&quot;https://photogabble.co.uk/projects/eleventyjs-interlink-plugin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Obsidian user too&lt;/a&gt; and was keen to incorporate one of the best features of Obsidian - Wiki Links! Now, I can use them in the site build without worrying too much about 11ty&#39;s weird internal linking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bnijenhuis.nl/notes/automatically-generate-open-graph-images-in-eleventy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Social Previews&lt;/a&gt; - I adopted the Social Previews outlined by Bernard Nijenhuis. This creates an SVG for each post and then saves a JPG version of it and adds it to the &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; of each page as an Open Graph element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stephango.com/flexoki&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Flexoki&lt;/a&gt; - I&#39;ve been really enjoying Steph Ango&#39;s work and stumbled across their Flexoki colour palette. It actually matched pretty closely with what I already had in mind with my initial sketches for this site. So I adopted Flexoki into my CSS and have been using HTML Variables throughout my CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chriscoyier.net/timeline/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Timeline&lt;/a&gt; - I didn&#39;t scope this in the initial build, but after I stumbled across Chris Coyier&#39;s site, I wanted to include something similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stephango.com/evergreen-notes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Evergreen Notes&lt;/a&gt; - Another Steph Ango feature which really resonated. I plan on going through my back catalogue of posts and adding them to the site - but I&#39;m keen to extract the little pearls of wisdom along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Testing the Kia EV6</title>

    <summary>Back with another EV review - this time it&#39;s the Kia EV6</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A year ago, over the Christmas break, I rented a Polestar 2 as my first foray into the land of electric vehicles. This year, I was in a similar predicament - a week away from home in Sydney and needing to rent a car. Europcar came to the party this time, adding a raft of new Kia EV6s to their fleet. The car looks great. I like the design and shape, especially the details in the lights and body panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/images/kia-ev6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kia EV6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our pickup didn&#39;t really go smoothly with Europcar. I&#39;ve done a few rentals with them recently and not had any issues - but when we arrived at 7.30pm there was no car ready on the lot and the only one available had around 50% charge. The fact that I had to book in advance and have the booking confirmed for this specific vehicle meant they knew I was coming and what time I would be there. After enquiring about a charge card or credit, I was informed that it wasn&#39;t on offer - take it or they can allocate a different car. I decided to go ahead and take the one available as we were hungry and keen to get on the road to eat and make a tour we had booked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sydneypoint.com.au/attractions/sydney-observatory/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Observatory Hill&lt;/a&gt; (which I recommend!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after about 30 more minutes, the car arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d read a lot about Kia and Hyundai as the kings of the EV world, producing great cars with the latest and greatest technology and all the features - fastest charging, big displays, and comfortable interiors. So I had high hopes for this experience. The EV6 is a pretty hefty car. It is probably a medium-sized sedan but sits higher. I was expecting lots of space, and there was in the cabin. The boot, however, was tiny. Our suitcases required a bit of Tetris to get them in and allow the automatic tailgate to close. There is no depth to the trunk at all - it&#39;s flat and very shallow. In the profile pic above, you can make out where the rear bumper ends, just before the brake light swoop. That&#39;s it. The whole boot is that deep, and the height disappears with the rake of the rear window. This is not family car territory and you would struggle with a pram and shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shock number two - connecting your phone. Yes, the Kia EV6 has carplay. It&#39;s not wireless, so you need to plug your phone in. There are a myriad of USB-C ports around the car. The thing is - they are &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;charging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ports - not &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ports. There is one USB data port that you need to use for Carplay - but it&#39;s USB-A. Plugging the phone in via USB-C port did nothing. Going through the menus and the phone would connect via Bluetooth, but not via the USB. We tried two cables, nothing – the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 minutes into hiring this car and I was not impressed. I was hungry though. So we used the unbuilt navigation to punch in our destination, Millers Point, and hit the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&#39;Driving Aids&#39;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve driven a Kia. The last time, it was a work car, and I hated every minute of it. The steering was spongy, the performance was less than enthusiastic and the build quality was questionable. I&#39;ve had that experience hanging over me ever since. So while I read a lot of positive reviews about these new EVs, I have to wonder - is it true? Have they changed? Are Kia&#39;s now drivable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first experience wasn&#39;t great. The car beeps, a lot. The nav likes to talk, a lot. Turning on your indicator displays a rear-facing camera on the side you are indicating up on the dash. Late at night on an unlit street, that just means your dash flashes black, and you&#39;re not sure if you&#39;ve broken the car. Your speed is off to the left of the dash, and the dead centre is a chart showing how Attentive a Driver you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way into Sydney from the Airport, it was sensory overload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to drive was impeded by the complexity of the car and the distractions provided by the multitude of &#39;driving aids&#39;. The car beeps, the steering wheel tugs, the nav warns of an impending school zone, speed limit change, camera, lane option — and all I want to do is concentrate on driving in Sydney traffic and make sure I&#39;m going the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Zombie Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is a thing. There&#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/xywCVMkvxCM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; and everything. This was the second time I&#39;d turned on the car and .... nothing. The car came on, but I couldn&#39;t drive. I couldn&#39;t change gears, put it into drive, nothing. My wife pulled out her phone and started Googling, finding the video above fairly quickly. But to have hit this issue on the second time in the car did not bode well on my overall experience so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It is an EV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I got out the manual, worked out the USB issue with the help of my mother-in-law&#39;s handy cable and got Apple Carplay running in the car. Now I could use the navigation I was used to, the display I was used to and concentrate on the car to drive with. I set up the seat and driving position better. I tried to get the Heads-Up-Display (HUD) working, but couldn&#39;t for the life of me adjust it to fit my preferred driving position. I&#39;ll admit I am all torso and ride high in the seat, but nothing abnormal or that a taller driver wouldn&#39;t encounter. Back on the road in daylight and the indicator cams made sense (to some degree). Yes, I can see behind me, but I&#39;m looking down to do so - my eyes off the road and what&#39;s in front. The cameras also don&#39;t show anything that I can&#39;t see from my mirrors. This seems like gadgetry for its own sake. The HUD is the same. If the layout of the dash was improved there is nothing I would need from this. Having the current speed on display is nice - so put it in the middle of the dash!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those frustrations aside, the EV6 is an EV, so you get nice immediate throttle response. The car is heavy, but heavy low to the ground so corners are easy and there is no body roll. Its flat and fast if you want it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car comes in three modes: Eco, Normal, and Sport. These seem to be configured in a slightly non-sensical way. In &lt;strong&gt;Eco&lt;/strong&gt;, the steering is heavy and the throttle mundane; it forces you to drive more conservatively in a very heavy-handed way. &lt;strong&gt;Normal&lt;/strong&gt; is just that, normal and how you would expect the car to behave. &lt;strong&gt;Sport&lt;/strong&gt; is an odd sensation. The throttle becomes super light and responsive, perhaps a bit too responsive. Alongside that, though, the steering also becomes much lighter. It means you can certainly throw the car around a bit more, but with the super-sensitive throttle, this is set up for a disaster. I did punch the throttle hard at one point and could feel the rear wheels kick out a bit. I almost over-corrected because the steering was too light. In a &#39;normal&#39; sport mode, everything becomes stiffer, so you get better feedback on the drive. Sport in the Kia is more akin to &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Fun Mode&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; – and I&#39;m not a fan of that. It&#39;s what a lot of people will do, but in a way that&#39;s not about the driver or driving the car well. I think Kia has really missed a beat here - but it&#39;s probably a choice that will be popular and reflects the popular concept of Sport rather than the reality of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Charging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with the car starting at 50% charge there was a need to charge it. I took the opportunity to head to the closest fast charge and see how it went. The Evie 150kw charger has two bays per &#39;bowser&#39; and will split the charge across the number of cars. I arrived at an empty charger and watched as the car maxed out at 150kw and then ducked out for a beer. The car was at 100% within 30 minutes. I thought I might have a bit longer, but no, this thing sucks down those electrons much faster than the Polestar 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Comfort&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EV6 is comfortable. There is oodles of space in the rear seats and the front seats are comfortable. Over the Christmas break we did a lot of ferrying of people and it handled it with style and comfort. The ride is nice, the performance of the car is great and so a lot of the shortcomings I had about Kia were forgotten. This is the best Kia I have driven and it&#39;s a great car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a big car, but not overly practical. If your primary aim is driving people around – you&#39;re in luck. It&#39;s spacious and comfortable. But if those people have stuff – then you&#39;re in for a shock. There&#39;s not a lot of boot space. There is no hidden compartment or any usable space in the &#39;frunk&#39;. Then there&#39;s the price. The EV6 is not cheap by Kia standards. It&#39;s not cheap by general car standards. This is an expensive car – and I&#39;m not sure it suits the price tag. The materials are more &#39;plasticy&#39; and the &#39;velour&#39; seat fabric wasn&#39;t my favourite. Nor were the white accents on the back seat. I can see this car looking very used very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, &#39;driver aids&#39; were more gimmick than useful, and some of the basics just weren&#39;t done well. The dash layout being the prime example and the UI for the whole infotainment felt dated and the menu system and settings were located in unintuitive spaces. If you want to charge the premium price, the experience has to reflect that. I wouldn&#39;t buy this. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it unless you&#39;re after an Uber vehicle which is unlikely to take anyone to the Airport, because the minute someone turns up with a suitcase it&#39;s going to be a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2023 - A Wrap</title>

    <summary>My end of year summary of 2023. It was quite the year!</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;2023... WTF was that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year felt crazy. It felt like there were a lot more down points this year as plans and projections kept failing and falling over. A lot was happening at work, and that&#39;s where most of my energy was drawn into. There were a couple of  highlights though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiji&lt;/strong&gt; - We had a great week in Fiji. There was a bit of drama, but it was such a good break during winter in a beautiful and friendly place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port Lincoln&lt;/strong&gt; - My wife and I headed to Port Lincoln to do the shark dive - jumping into a steel cage to see real-life Great White Sharks in their natural habitat. We saw four different sharks on the day! We spent the other days exploring the local area, the two national parks and some amazing sights and fresh seafood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birthdays&lt;/strong&gt; - My mum&#39;s 70th and brother&#39;s 40th birthdays were this year. Mum&#39;s was a big family event and the first in a few years. It was great to see all the cousins and nieces all together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graduation&lt;/strong&gt; - Seeing Ms A graduate from primary school. It&#39;s a much bigger deal than I remember, but it is a significant milestone for her and us as parents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of work highlights too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colombia&lt;/strong&gt; - I gave an online presentation as part of the federal Department of Education &amp;amp; Training&#39;s initiative in South America. I did one last year for Brazil, so was aware of the bi-lingual nature of the event and what was involved. There were over 350 people in attendance on Zoom, which I was super impressed by.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACODE LTLI&lt;/strong&gt; - A week in Queensland in August is never a bad thing. This institute was a lot of work and effort, though. It was great to get out of my bubble and meet a bunch of new people, as well as get to know my colleagues from Adelaide better during our downtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Change at work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was tremendous change at work, with the bulk of it starting in February and dragging out until August. I watched my career trajectory, or at least the way I imagined it going, crumble in front of my eyes. All the work I&#39;ve been doing over the last three years seemed to be leading to a specific point, and it seemed to be all on track. That all got completely derailed pretty early in the year, and I spent the rest of the year spinning. Rather than having leadership that steadied the ship and provided clear direction, we seemed to have the opposite — management keen on disruption for its own sake, an inability to communicate and unwillingness to engage their teams, under-baked ideas, no plans for operations and an obsession with adding more and more instability and momentum to the spiral and spin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December has come, and my previous career path has disappeared in front of me. I&#39;ve felt increasingly angry, disrupted and troubled by this. I guess it is part of a grieving process, and I need to be comfortable with that being what has happened - grief. There was something clear and tangible that has taken away. There has been a loss, and it seems right to grieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone in experiencing this, but it&#39;s probably the first time in my life I&#39;ve felt that I wasn&#39;t going in the right direction, not just in an upward direction but in general. Much of the effort I have put into things hasn&#39;t been rewarded or, honestly, even recognised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my problem is making space for this grieving process to happen, to re-evaluate my position and make some decisions. One of the fundamental challenges of &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/knowledge-work/&quot;&gt;Knowledge Work&lt;/a&gt; is it involves your brain and thinking, which means making space and separating work and life is incredibly challenging. I found the two inexorably linked and that both were affecting each other. The problems at work bled into home life. The time needed to think ate into family time. I find this difficulty of knowledge work to be different from manual labour, especially when the job requires a machine or a specific location to do the work. Separation becomes easier if it is physical; there&#39;s a clear demarcation point in the day between work and family. At the end of this year I&#39;ve been completely exhausted all of the time. My brain is done and I haven&#39;t been there for my family or able to engage in the other pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the week off I&#39;ve had so far - I can see there needs to be some pretty fundamental changes in 2024. I want to spend the first few weeks of the year working through that. I have to really reevaluate this whole work/life balance concept, but the focus needs to be on &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve probably hit that midlife crisis point in terms of my career. I have started to ask myself that fundamental question — &lt;em&gt;what am I doing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t really enjoyed going to work this year. I don&#39;t think work should make you sad or angry. The culture has changed significantly over the last year and it hasn&#39;t made it a pleasant place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said the people I work with and those that I have recruited into the team are amazing. One of the positives of the year has been the fact that I&#39;ve spent more time collaborating across teams and areas. That&#39;s been incredibly fulfilling and I honestly think if that hadn&#39;t happened this year would have felt a lot darker than it has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A new plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&#39;s time to evaluate where I am and where I am going. Luckily, I&#39;ve got time to do that over January as I&#39;ve taken four weeks off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up to my 40th birthday, everything was looking good. We made a big change moving to Adelaide and taking on new jobs. Covid hit and that&#39;s had a much bigger effect on my life than I thought. There&#39;s a trauma that we&#39;ve gone through over the last few years that still hasn&#39;t been processed. So much changed - not just from the lockdowns, but how we interact, who we interact with and the confidence to get out there. Covid was such a big disruption and such a big traumatic event that life returning to normal really means now its normality wrapped around the trauma and isolation that occurred. It&#39;s not a return to &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;normal + trauma&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can feel now a deep need to connect. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve spent a lot on the other things outside of work — individual pursuits, connection opportunities, socialising and networking. Work has been a leech on my energy and it&#39;s had a real parasitic effect on my wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, instead, I want to put effort into those spaces that give me energy and to seek out more joy and positivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s to 2024!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What becomes of Australian Rugby?</title>

    <summary>A bit of a dive into my favourite sport, and what Australia needs to do to fix the downward spiral of the national team.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, the Wallabies lost to Wales and ended their World Cup run. It was probably the worst match I&#39;ve seen the Wallabies play. That&#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It. Was. The. Worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who watched the Ireland vs. South Africa game on the same weekend, that was a game on another level. If you watched the way the Fiji team played against the Wallabies, you could see it there too. The difference was the sense of national identity and way of playing the game. There is a distinct Irish, South African, Fijian, French, and Kiwi style of play. Attached to that is a national pride in their game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loss and a win born from that distinct way of playing is bearable. There is pride in playing that style of game regardless of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wallabies haven&#39;t had this for a long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot wrong with the state of Australian rugby, its governance, structure and operations that have compounded this issue. But at its heart, Australia has no game, no style and nothing distinctive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is symptomatic of Australian professional sport in general, which has prioritised the brilliance of individuals over the team for so long that we’ve forgotten what a team is and what it has to do in order to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to save rugby one of the most important things we have to do is articulate &lt;strong&gt;what Australian Rugby is and what it looks like&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 20 years, we have adapted the game to suit the players we can put on the field rather than build a specific identity around how we want to play the game. What that means is a completely incoherent message for players and fans: as availability, injury, and age of players change, so too does the game itself. As we swap out yet another underperforming coach, we destroy any stability or coherence that had been building. Every coaching change for the last 15 years has just patched over the deep cracks within the game itself. More important than the game is this national identity of &lt;em&gt;what we want the game to be&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;What it can be&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The All Blacks, Springboks, Irish, Welsh,  Fijians and French all have a clear identity of what they want the game to be and how they want to play it. And what that means is that there is a clear baseline of expectations. There is a default way of playing that these teams can fall back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas the Wallabies fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it in the smaller nations, like the Chileans, the Samoans, and even the Romanians - there is a way of playing this game that they&#39;ve grown into and they love it. And love is what’s missing from the Wallabies. There is little to love about the way we are playing the game. Yes, there are individuals who can exhibit brilliance in every game -  it’s far from a team effort, and it’s far from consistent. The hero of one game becomes the villain of the next. As tactics change and teams adapt to those individuals so goes our fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than dwell on what went wrong, I think it&#39;s time for us to have a bigger discussion about what we want rugby to be and how we as a nation want to play it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not to undercut the problems with the organisation and at the grassroots - but we’re never going to solve those until we can articulate what rugby in Australia should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting this vision right ensures that all the required changes and what must be built to strengthen the game have a shared purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting down the foundation of the game that we want to see will attract the right players and coaches. It will aid rather than hinder recruitment and talent development. We’ll spend money in the right places on the right players with the right skill set to play the game of rugby we want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I want to see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running rugby&lt;/strong&gt; - we have always had some of the best running players on the planet. We all want to see Aussies with the ball in hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tries&lt;/strong&gt; - I can take a loss on penalties if we go for a try every time. Aussies want to see the ball across the line or die trying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical kicking&lt;/strong&gt; - playing the game from the 9 does little for running rugby or the kind of kicking that encourages scoring tries. A rush defence has holes in it which a kicker can exploit. The 50-22 rule is made for attacking and tactical kicking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contested breakdowns&lt;/strong&gt; - we have a history of the best jackaling forwards in the game. This kind of bastardy is the best kind of defence and should be our first line of attack. We’ve forgotten the art and mongrel we once had in this space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack, attack, attack&lt;/strong&gt; - there is something about the Australian mentality that prizes attack over defence. We want our team to attack at every opportunity, which means every contest. This isn’t just about what we do with the ball, it’s what we do when we don’t have it. We have to unleash the mongrel and fighting spirit of Australia. This isn’t about being the underdog but about being the dog and choosing to take the fight to the opposition at every opportunity. I’ll take any loss, no matter how bad, as long as we contest and attack at every opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than a one-trick pony&lt;/strong&gt; - As a team, we have to be able to adapt to tactical changes. We need to have more than one game plan, and we need to be able to adapt to change within a play or two rather than 60 minutes later when the game is done. That means better on-field decision-making and more tactical team coaching - not the reliance on individual brilliance we have seen. We have become the most tactically devoid team on the planet, and it’s been the source of many losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem we have is not the quality of the players; it&#39;s that we don&#39;t play as a team, and we don&#39;t play as a nation. We don&#39;t take risks because we fear failure. We don’t play cohesively because we don’t play as a team with clarity of visions and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this comes back to how we’ve structured our domestic teams. Rather than reflecting a distinctive national form of the game, each state franchise that feeds the professional game plays an entirely different style of game. To expect these players to form a cohesive structure and style of play is ridiculous. This starkly contrasts New Zealand, where the teams play a cohesive Kiwi game with slight variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to do better, and it starts with creating a vision for what we want the Wallabies to be and how we want them to play!&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Some thoughts on work and how things have been faring.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey there blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while and I’ve been neglectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life has been going on at a pace and with speed. Work has been crazy. As we discuss a University merger there’s been a reorganisation, a new team structure, the loss of an old team and a reprioritisation of work. Not at my choice or behest, but so it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve struggled with this round of changes, and I had to question myself about that. I feel like I’ve always been working on the edge of change, in that ambiguous state between new and old. If I’ve worked in the innovation space for so long, where I live and breathe change – why has this time been different? I think I understand it now, but it took a while to work through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large part of my experience has been around grief. A lot of what has happened has been the end of things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team I originally joined is gone. We’ve been disbanded and repackaged beyond all recognition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team I assembled anew and recruited for has also been changed beyond recognition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The manager who hired me went on to pursue something new and ended up leaving the institution completely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the projects that I’ve been leading have finished – successful in their outcome but without acknowledgement or celebration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the work I’ve been doing hasn’t evolved in the way that I expected. I imagined riding the wave of developing these new online programs through to a more senior role. I poured a lot of myself, energy and time into that idea and outcome. But things haven’t worked out that way. Decisions have been made, or not, to pursue things in differently – one that doesn’t seem to include me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my grief is connected to that. That loss of professional self, one that I’d been working so hard towards. From moving to a new city to working through the pandemic to going through the stress of hard deadlines and deliverables, to trying to manage the toll on my team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve wondered if the effort was worth it. I’ve played through the “What ifs?” I’ve asked myself why and come up blank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spawned grief over my effort and my time. I now acknowledge that there was a huge waste of effort. A lack of acknowledgement of what has been achieved has rubbed salt into the wound. The lack of recognition of the expertise I’ve spent years developing has been hurtful. Recognising that the organisation doesn’t care has been challenging. I’ve cared. I’ve probably cared too much. But the organisation doesn’t have feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 360° review demonstrated how little care there was. How little appreciation and recognition had been shown to all that work. I focused too much on getting things done that I didn’t see the impact that was having on me, or how others perceived me. From my team, peers and managers — I barely lived up to my own expectations, and I certainly didn’t see much recognition of what’s been achieved. But this is something I’ve been dealing with for a while – the invisibility of my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve felt frustrated at work for most of this year. Frustrated and ignored. When the future is a version of what I’ve just spent four years working on — I expected to be acknowledged and included in the decision-making. Instead, I was ignored. I get that not everyone has been on the same journey, but when you’ve been the pioneer, trailblazing and encountering all the ‘firsts’ – you’d think the organisation might want to hear about that. To learn from it. I guessed wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I fumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I smouldered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it went out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That frustration just left one day. I accepted what was, and what had been, but now is different. I can make this what I want to be. Nothing has made it better. I don’t think anything has changed at all — except me. The one thing I can control and affect and change is me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s the aim. To stop doing what I was doing because it didn’t work. To look towards opportunities and to create my own. To embrace change again. What happens will happen, and regardless of how things have been perceived — I know the truth. I know what I did, what I achieved and what came out of those actions. Even if no one else can, I can see it and I’ve felt the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your Audience Awaits</title>

    <summary>Some additional thoughts on Meta&#39;s Threads</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2023/07-07-social-to-antisocial/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;quick post on some thoughts about the launch of Threads&lt;/a&gt;, which was a way for me to articulate one of the things I&#39;ve loved about joining the Fediverse – the really &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; nature of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week or so on, and Threads is up to 100 million users, and there&#39;s been plenty of hot takes and commentary posted. I won&#39;t be joining. I don&#39;t want Meta in my life any more, and I only stay rooted to it because many friends and family have no alternative online presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the commentary, what I have picked up as a giant &amp;quot;plus&amp;quot; is that it&#39;s simple and easy to assemble an audience. Many people joining from Instagram inherit the same followers in this new space. And many people want that. Journalists, critics, and media personalities want an audience — that is why they are on social media. It&#39;s not about the &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; aspects - it&#39;s the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s not what you get in the Fediverse. There are no followers ready to go. There is no easy way to aggregate people into an audience or disseminate your work. There&#39;s no algorithm to boost you or pay to promote you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From discussions in &lt;a href=&quot;https://megaphone.link/VMP4819911436&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pivot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/podcasts/special-episode-metas-twitter-rival-arrives-with-adam-mosseri.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Hard Fork&lt;/a&gt; — the benefits of Threads is the pre-built audience you have. The fact is the whole application is gamed around giving you an audience. It&#39;s also what brands want, what advertisers want – let&#39;s remember that the launch of Threads is not a life raft for those seeking refuge from the ever Right-leaning and sinking ship that is Twitter. It&#39;s about recruiting those advertisers and revenue. As Twitter tanks, there&#39;s a lot of money to be made by those who are ruthless to jump in and provide a viable alternative with the same goals at heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;Audience = Money&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it – that&#39;s what Threads is: the cannibalisation of Twitter&#39;s audience and advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to say that this whole &amp;quot;distributed&amp;quot; social network thing isn&#39;t real. Threads isn&#39;t distributed or federated. BlueSky isn&#39;t either – there are no other instances, nor is there any operability available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no real effort from Meta to do anything new or embrace new technology – it just saves them from developing their own. They can avoid contributing anything to establishing a standard. Instead, they pick it up straight away – throw a few hundred engineers at it, and make the technology behind real federation - like Mastodon - look unwieldy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gap is going to open up between this next set of apps and those currently forming the entirety of the fediverse. One side will be open, the other will focus on an &lt;a href=&quot;https://timklapdor.wordpress.com/2015/11/26/social-media-a-story-of-exploitation-enclosure-and-enslavement/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;enclosure&lt;/a&gt;, trapping users into an ecosystem and audience they can&#39;t leave behind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Social to Antisocial</title>
    <link href="https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2023/07-07-social-to-antisocial/"/>

    <summary>A social space without dialogue is not social – it is antisocial. The current model is insular, monologic, performative, ad and surveillance driven, and increasingly toxic.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; has launched, and now Facebook (aka Meta) has entered/reentered the fractured social space created by Musk&#39;s Twitter. People are rushing to the platform, mainly because those inside the Facebook realm on Instagram have a zero-friction signup. What is perhaps not noticeable to most of those people is their passive agreement to intrusive surveillance and advertising. At nearly 250MB for what is essentially a text reader, you have to wonder - &lt;strong&gt;what have they packed into that code base?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I wanted to note some ideas about what social media means and perhaps what it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; mean as we enter a new phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that social media, as we understand it today, wasn&#39;t ever really social. It wasn&#39;t about creating social spaces or communities; it was only about leveraging existing social networks and relationships to sell your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook&#39;s original premise wasn&#39;t connecting the world - it was a game of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/feature/hotornot-history-20-year-anniversary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Hot-or-Not&lt;/a&gt;. It used existing social networks and university campuses, not its own unique ability to connect people to create an audience. It played into the social psychology of young people but offered little social return or value. Instead, the company&#39;s value became the audience it provided, not the social connections or ability to find and form relationships. It provided eyeballs, and all it asked you to do was perform. It wasn&#39;t to communicate; that&#39;s too boring, and people leave the app and go on with their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, here you had to &lt;strong&gt;perform&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media has only ever been social in name. It pillaged your existing networks and communities to harvest data to build a graph &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; owned. &lt;em&gt;Your&lt;/em&gt; relationships became &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; relationships in an instant. Platforms never encouraged or even enabled dialogue. What they enabled was simultaneous monologues that fit the model of performance. A social space without dialogue is not social – it is antisocial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And every platform followed the same model — insular, monologic, performative, ad and surveillance driven, and increasingly toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the Fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small cluster of apps using a shared protocol began to retake and carve out a social space built upon social ideals like federation rather than centralised control. Each space could be its own community, but its participants had the ability to connect with others outside their own space. Communities could also put walls up – exclusion is part of feeling connection - and the fediverse created a multitude of ways to engage in that practice. Things were porous but there were layers of safety and protection available. What the Fediverse didn&#39;t provide was an audience. It didn&#39;t reward performance, and that&#39;s helped keep it sane and real. It&#39;s why many haven&#39;t joined too. Without a pre-made audience, what is it all for? That question is valid for those who have built a career and reputation based on their audience and their ability to engage with it and perform for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That barrier of not having an audience has allowed something different to grow and flourish in the Fediverse, something that feels more social and more communal. It isn&#39;t divorced from conflict or harm, but the scale and performative value of attack is greatly diminished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there was Threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s too early to say what the impact will be on the Fediverse, but it won&#39;t be good if it shares any of the platforms&#39; attributes before it. The massification it offers is not a positive for the Fediverse. The nature of all things Facebook is driven by performance and audience rather than any true meaning of social.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>A brief idea for a Connected Curriculum, what that might be and how it might work.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last four years, I’ve been overseeing the development of online programs at the University of Adelaide, and for the past 15 years, I’ve been involved in the development of courses, programs, media and assessments and aligning those things back into curriculum and program design, constructive alignment and accreditation requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems that I’ve seen consistently during that time is that each one of those components has its own separate workflow, ways of working and related data. None of these elements connect, talk, link back or feed into each other. They also share a similar disconnection – time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most curriculum is developed linearly with very few feedback loops or iterations in the process. If feedback exists, it&#39;s usually measured in years, not months or even semesters. Most data and artefacts remain static throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Program information is usually developed at the very beginning of the process. If any changes happen when a course is developed, it rarely feeds back into that original documentation. There are often important reasons for making ad hoc changes that add value to courses, but there’s no facility to track what they are, why they happened, or measure and see how they impact things at the program level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we could connect data about the curriculum throughout its development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if instead of static documents, we utilised data throughout the workflow – to not only map out a program but to help detail what and when specific skills and knowledge are not only introduced but developed and applied too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/connected-curriculum/&quot;&gt;Connected Curriculum&lt;/a&gt; would provide a way to engage with learning design across a program through courses, assessments and potential specific activities and tasks. It would allow us to set parameters for learning at a high level and, as a course is developed, demonstrate and show when and how that learning develops, where students engage with concepts and how they go about applying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also map accreditation requirements not just to courses but to individual tasks and assessments. If those assessments are linked to the LMS, you could pull examples of students’ work across the grading scheme from live courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than just a map of possibilities, as you create courses, you could feed up information about the student experience into the program view live and as it happens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much time have students spent on specific activities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have they done group work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have they completed specific accreditation requirements?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When and what is the evidence they have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that this is completely impossible today because the data model doesn’t exist. The modularity of programs, courses and hours is not specified correctly. One can’t zoom in if the detail isn’t there. There is no “&lt;em&gt;enhance&lt;/em&gt;” button that provides data that isn’t there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/connected-curriculum/&quot;&gt;Connected Curriculum&lt;/a&gt; isn’t new, but it is still missing from most organisations working within education. While many aspects have been standardised and now require accreditation, much of the process is still opaque. It’s hard to visualise because of the atomisation of education and ed-tech – where many tools exist to perform ever-specialised teaching functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can see how it could work. By creating a flexible data model, a clear link between course and program could be made. Using simple tools, like tags and standard nomenclature and a modular approach to course design, it’s not only possible but holds the potential to be a breakthrough in creating higher quality courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently completed a round of work on some program mapping and then applied this straight into course design, and I can see how useful a &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/connected-curriculum/&quot;&gt;Connected Curriculum&lt;/a&gt; would be. Having created capstone courses for programs that I had nothing to do with developing, I can attest to how useful a &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/connected-curriculum/&quot;&gt;Connected Curriculum&lt;/a&gt; would have been. Having gone through accreditation processes before, I can see how important a &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/connected-curriculum/&quot;&gt;Connected Curriculum&lt;/a&gt; can be – and how much work it requires when it doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, this is just an idea, but I can see how it connects to some of the work I’ve already done. A way to connect program design to learning design in more tangible and visible ways would be incredibly powerful for institutions to have and for the staff working across these areas. It would help empower academics and designers at all levels to create better student learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Work Heroics</title>

    <summary>I have a fatal flaw when it comes to work. I&#39;m too quick to jump in and save the day. It’s not performative. It’s not for others — it’s for me. It’s a self-imposed desire, or need, to not let things fail. It&#39;s probably always been there - but I&#39;d never really had a way of defining it before.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h3&gt;My Work Heroics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These heroics have been an asset in a lot of my work. They encourage my creativity by engaging with problems and seeking solutions. For projects that are off the rails or find themselves in dire straits or all good conscience will fall over — I come along and rescue them. I plug holes, I pull together resources, and more often than not, I throw myself into the breach. As an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/expert-generalist-workplace&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;expert generalist&lt;/a&gt;, this encourages and feeds my broad skill set. So, for many reasons, this is a positive for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for the last couple of years, it hasn’t felt that positive. When problems are occasional, this heroism can be useful and rewarding. For the last couple of years, it’s been a hindrance. The projects I’ve been working on have been new initiatives. They don’t have a playbook and a track to follow. Resourcing was a guesstimate, and much of what I&#39;ve spent my time doing could be considered &lt;em&gt;known unknowns&lt;/em&gt;. There were always expectations that we wouldn&#39;t have issues or that problems would arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, rather than the exception to the rule - problems have become the rule. In the beginning, we joked in the team that fires were always springing up. You put one out, and another would sprint up. For the last 18 months, it&#39;s felt very different — everything is on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:900x500/1200x800/filters:focal(450x250:451x251):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6438793/this-is-fine.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the comic strip from KC Green – &lt;a href=&quot;http://gunshowcomic.com/648&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;This is fine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I can see now is that while the heroics got things across the line and helped create success, they did nothing to reduce many of the underlying problems. Many solutions happened at an operational level through dialogue and conversation because most of the problems were human. Therefore, most of the knowledge about this work was tacit. It never had to be written down or documented. In fact - a lot of the heroics were to prevent things from &lt;em&gt;becoming explicit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work was done to prevent deadlines from being missed, overcome or remove problems, and work with staff so complaints and issues weren’t filed or issues logged. My work really has been so focused on patching over the cracks and delivering things that are of high quality and timely that the projects &lt;em&gt;look flawless&lt;/em&gt;. All of the structural deficiencies don’t show up. I applied the fix before the break has been noticed. I’ve been the hero again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I’m tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to address the underlying issues and have not really had the success I anticipated. I seem to have been met with a “Problem? What problem?” reaction. All the work I’ve poured myself into is invisible to everyone except those it directly affects. I’ve had some fantastic working relationships along the way, which has been great. But relationships are invisible, too. So much of my work is intangible, the effort of thinking of a solution to a problem, the mitigation of an issue so that it doesn&#39;t happen. If the organisation doesn’t see it, it doesn&#39;t really matter. It doesn&#39;t care about relationships, even though it likes to say it does. There&#39;s lots of talk about &lt;strong&gt;Stakeholder Engagement&lt;/strong&gt; but very little about dialogue, discussion, compromise and understanding - all tacit components of getting things done. The explicit, Have a Meeting, is more important than the tacit, Achieve a Result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be a case for making my work more explicit, &lt;em&gt;but that changes the work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be a case for letting things fail, &lt;em&gt;but failure has consequences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you let things fail when you don’t have to? Do you continue playing out the trolley problem when the emergency brake is right there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This heroic mindset probably grew from a habit of procrastination. Work that I don’t find engaging gets left to last. Rather than being planned and methodical, I opted to be fast and dramatic. Last-ditch appointments, late nights, last-minute saves - it becomes a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My early career was in small businesses where a fuck up would not just lose me a job but close down a business. My heroics probably got more formalised in this environment. I came to expect it from myself. I could make impossible things happen. I could move a mountain. And I felt I needed to. There was a duty and pride wrapped up in &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; letting things fail. I could save everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing enough superhero lore, I can see all of this being played out by Marvel and DC characters in comics and movies. Maybe that’s why I enjoyed Ben Affleck’s Batman - there was a distinct “I’m over this shit” vibe that resonated with me. There&#39;s a limit to the heroics, and it gets to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it, though — I don’t have a solution. Just a description of the problem. I can’t seem to perform heroics on myself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two to one, or maybe something new</title>

    <summary>Some initial thoughts on the possible merger between the University of Adelaide and the University of South Australia.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s not a secret, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adelaide.edu.au/creating-a-university-for-the-future/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;plans for a merger of two universities in Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment, we’re in the proposal stage, investigating the viability of the merger and developing a business case for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a number of perspectives, there is a case to be made. Most of these relate to being too small to operate globally. While that may be true, it does make me question whether the purpose of a university has changed so drastically over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universities in Australia are a function of each individual state and not of the national federal government. They are brought into being by an act of state parliament, and while there is an operational distance, they are a public service run for and by the state. The way the merger is being articulated at the moment sees the contribution of universities quite differently. They are now an “exporter” of education, bringing in a billion or so dollars into the local economy from international students. It’s also being framed as a grow house for the next generation of research and skills required by an ambitious military program. These two components are seen as drivers for change and form the basis of merger discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, South Australian universities are too small to be recognised internationally and would fare far better on rankings across the board if we merged. This would lead to a proposed increase in student numbers to drive that export function and increased research funding because our reputation would rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m not unsupportive of these moves, I wonder if they signal a fundamental shift in how we see ourselves. They are certainly a shift from local concerns and push the university&#39;s role into a global realm, one we might not all feel comfortable joining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also makes me wonder how this approach informs decision-making moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Risks and Opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s play out the fact that the merger will go ahead. I think it will because the appetite is there to make it happen - the only way I see it being halted is cost. The universities are working away feverishly to pull together a business model before the state government. Part of that will be to gold plate the plans and ensure there are enough golden parachutes on offer for those at risk of losing their job - there will not be two Vice Chancellors. So let’s just say it happens, I think there are a couple of different ways you could set this up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elimination&lt;/strong&gt;: going through the catalogue of services, systems and products offered by the two universities and choosing the “best” one to continue. This is probably the quickest and ”simplest” way to proceed. Simple, as in the choice is binary rather than multifaceted. It’s faster because of this in the short term, but it is incredibly risky and challenging. Systems tend not to work together just because you want them to. There is a lot of tacit knowledge embedded in staff around how things work, and uprooting that creates its own challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amalgamation&lt;/strong&gt;: going through the list and merging features from both institutions. Taking longer than elimination, this would be the development of a “best of breed” approach to products and services. The complexity of this approach is that it requires consensus around what “best” looks like. Best is often an emergent and multifaceted property that depends on the individual&#39;s perspective and priority. While this way of working has a lot of people and process challenges, this is an opportunity. Consensus onboards people during the process rather than after. It also can be done quickly if facilitated well - but given existing university practices and a history of death by committee, that is a challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-creation&lt;/strong&gt;: taking the knowledge of both institutions to reimagine their functions and ways of working. This requires more imagination, but it starts with a clean slate and asks “what if…?”. Given the size and scale of change, this might seem daunting, but re-imagining and recreating the university as a new entity is a massive opportunity. If you want to discard some of the legacy and deadwood accumulated in the system and structures, now is the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I can see that, in most cases, a mixture of the first two will be adopted, I want to make a case for Re-creation and spend some time there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbundled from the inertia of existing models, re-creation is an opportunity to change how and why we do things radically. It’s an opportunity to be radical and unencumbered. It offers a massive opportunity to be creative and sets the new institution apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the time for &lt;strong&gt;Radical Ideas&lt;/strong&gt;. Something new is on the table, and I don’t think it is time to shy away from radical ideas. Instead, we should be seeing them out. One of the biggest problems I see in the merger discussion so far is a lack of differentiation. How will this University be different? How will it be unique? Moving to be more relevant to a global audience means entering a crowded marketplace. You have to have something different to sell. You have to have a value proposition, and at the moment, I don’t see one other than the geographic location. It’s the same degrees offered at every Australian institution, following the same basic structure, using the same tools and teaching techniques in almost identical rooms. What is it about Adelaide University that’s different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here are a couple of ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set a unified curriculum.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curriculum is one area you could differentiate quite easily. The curriculum is ripe for disruption because most universities lack a clear and unified vision. It’s murky and messy and often relatable for students. What drives students is the qualification, not the journey they go on or the road they take. Mainly because they don’t know it’s there in the first place, but also because it relates too much to over-ambitious and vague motherhood statements. What if, instead, we made the basis of our curriculum something more real and tangible? The &lt;a href=&quot;https://sdgs.un.org/goals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;UN Sustainable Development Goals&lt;/a&gt; are real and formally agreed to, not by a bunch of white guys but through global collaboration. They provide clarity of mission and a diverse portfolio of ideas that set a bigger mission for higher education. Aligning with the SDGs sets the University up on the global stage as a way to participate and contribute to their development and longevity that benefits the world. This aligns with the global vision of the new university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Turn costs into income.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, one of the most innovative actions I’ve seen is when organisations turn costs into income. Renewable energy is one of those, where instead of paying for power ad infinitum, installing solar and wind provides power and generates income. It&#39;s a capital investment, but universities are designed to be here for the long term. So what if we apply this idea to other areas? One that Is ripe for disruption is IT infrastructure. At the moment, universities spend ever-increasing amounts of money on IT systems, and that cost is only set to rise. As Cory Doctorow points out, platforms (and, more broadly, businesses in general) follow a pattern of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;enshittification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most universities have benefitted from sharp pricing for IT services across the board, leading to the disestablishment of internal IT services in favour of those provided on the cloud. Software and hardware as a service have seen most universities eliminate on-site internal servers (the ones that formed the original Internet) and move everything into the cloud. The same can be said for student information systems and the learning management system - all cloud-based and monopolistic. Almost every University now spends millions of dollars annually as a tax to Microsoft and AWS for hardware and a handful of software vendors to run their core business. Without spending that money, the University could not exist. They are now trapped into paying this indefinitely, and because the competition has been eaten up over time, we are now in a monopolistic vice. Over the next few years, we will see the vice tighten, and the costs rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to exit this state is to escape it entirely. Applying the same ideals as renewable energy - what if the new University set itself up to run independently as a sovereign entity, not reliant on 3rd party vendors and their costs? What if it embraced open-source software and collective hardware, not just as a consumer but as a contributor? What if it then sold those services and knowledge to others? Aligned with the SDGs, this could create a global powerhouse of development that would directly improve the University, the globe and the local community. This could start a new industry and sector in the state, which aligns with several defence objectives. This is how AWS started - a cost centre transformed into an income generator. Universities consume so much IT yet contribute little back to the broader community in positive ways. This could change all that while creating a new EdTech sector based here in Adelaide but with a global outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reimagine jobs and work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant changes and challenges over the last 20 years has been in the work required by a university and what jobs are needed to do it. As universities have scaled up, the requirements on staff have changed. The traditional role of the academic as a researcher with a side gig in teaching is nothing more than an antiquated memory. It no longer exists, and nor can it. The requirements have changed so dramatically - volumes for teaching are massive, research requirements border on ludicrous, and the administration required to run a modern university is off the charts. The academy of old is no more and needs to be rethought and reimagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cope with the seismic changes in academia, a new and substantial change has occurred alongside it - the rise of precarious work. To allow the academy to continue with its role, it has filled the gaps with ever-increasing numbers of casual staff. We are now operating in a world where most university teaching is carried out by casual staff, surviving contact to contact on barely sustainable wages, with holidays or sick leave and no career progression available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the commensurate rise in professional staff - those required to manage and ensure things are done, even to a minimal degree, in a way that marries the requirements of operating a large-scale and legislated industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work at the University needs to be reimagined. We need to lose the current structures that hide the workers and the jobs to be done while at the same time maintaining a system of power and benefit for a chosen few incumbents of the system. We need to rethink work and how to balance it with life, health and prosperity. We have to move away from models of extraction and exploration. We must be fair, free and sustainable in our approach to work. To utilise technology not as a system of oppression but as a way of gaining freedom. To look at jobs as things we want to do rather than a crushing requirement to sustain life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Be visionary, be real.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universities have earned themselves a reputation for operating in ivory towers. Much of what happens within higher education is distinct and separate from the rest of the world. Now is not the time for that. I would love a new University to be explicit with its mission to engage with local problems, to ground research in community issues and to develop knowledge to aid and understand our local communities. Whilst a global perspective is important, we have to see universities as places that are embedded and serve their community as a primary purpose, but with connections that ensure we are situated within a global network. This doesn’t require us to focus on a specific field of research but instead ground it in our own communities. Make it relatable, connected and involved rather than aloof, disconnected and abstract. The UN SDGs would help with that as a way to focus efforts, but being grounded in local initiatives is critical. We must maintain the global perspective while at the same time supporting the lands we stand on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learning is life.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Australia, we have been steadily moving towards a problem the US has been struggling with for the last two decades - how to balance getting an education with living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, this shouldn&#39;t be something we should consider. Still, the financial realities, the cost of getting an education with current wages, job insecurity and a fragile economy mean that education is becoming a choice rather than an expectation. When students have to choose between a lifetime of debt and insecure work vs the same wage but without the obligation, education will be the loser. The value proposition of higher education has been diminishing over time. We must accept our role in contributing to student debt and failing to engage with students holistically beyond their learning and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a new university, we should be thinking more holistically about our dealing with students. One way to do that is to offer an all-encompassing undergraduate experience that combines learning, accommodation and work. Rather than competing priorities, what if we ensured that they worked together? The acts of living, learning and work all actively contributed to and benefited each other. As students, we created a whole life experience, ensuring that they had the space to grow and learn as individuals in ways that benefit their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One simple way we could do that is to recognise that the university requires labour, and students can (and already do) play a role in that. What if we formalised that, planned for it and ensured it fed into a broader experience?  We could offer flexible learning arrangements if we allowed students to speed up and slow down their studies. To make it &amp;quot;seasonal&amp;quot; and ensure sufficient breaks in learning for other things to occur. This could reduce most students&#39; mental strain and give them time to gain additional skills and knowledge tangential to study. They could be involved in university projects to enable research and support our global mission, and most importantly, they would be paid to do this. By planning this more holistically, we can make learning with the new university far more beneficial financially and as citizens actively contributing to their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learning is lifelong&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education shouldn’t be terminal and end in a degree. As more and more work shifts to knowledge work and as individuals who are more likely to switch fields and careers throughout our lives, we have to move towards an ongoing education model. One that can be accessed throughout our lives rather than as a one-off. We actually need a model of lifelong learning. In some ways, this may not always be about access to courses but the resources, libraries, facilities, networks, and research that universities contain. What if we made the university a porous experience? One that you flow through repeatedly as your life and career change. You can move through and engage with the University in various ways, and it is priced accordingly. Whilst many have suggested a subscription model, that is certainly part of it, we need to understand that there will be periods of active and passive engagements, so it must be a model that can change and adapt to different stages in life. We need differentiated products that support this model and tiered pricing that not only covers costs but, importantly, instils value. In this way, we can move to a funding model that is less reliant on the ebbs and flows of government but one that aligns with our students and aids them in developing into citizens. It is moving to create ongoing and committed relationships rather than the &amp;quot;one night stand&amp;quot; equivalents we currently have.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Malcolm Harris&#39; very different history of Silicon Valley brought about some thinking about hierarchy and their heirs to wealth and riches.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve written about hierarchy a few times and often relate it back to being the default structure. The reason I believe this is because it’s a &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; structure. It’s something that can be deployed quickly, works fairly efficiently, and can be established and refined as you go along. It&#39;s a &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; system of organisation well suited to deployment in simple problem spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other reasons that hierarchies are a default is because it’s a power structure with its own power dynamic. For those at the top, the hierarchy is really beneficial. Along with the power to decide, comes wealth in a variety of different shapes and forms. Therefore, hierarchy is often a desirable form and structure despite how well it functions as a system of organisation and if it is performant in its duties. If something innately enables someone and gives them power, there’s a reason to not only deploy a hierarchy but to maintain a hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techwontsave.us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tech Won’t Save Us&lt;/a&gt; podcast with &lt;a href=&quot;https://techwontsave.us/episode/155_the_untold_history_of_silicon_valley_w_malcolm_harris/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Malcolm Harris&lt;/a&gt;, which discusses a very different history of Silicon Valley than the narrative that we often get told. The topics discussed were numerous and diverse - from eugenics, racism, nuclear weapons, myths of hippies and anti-authoritarianism, and some retelling (with added truth and context) to the stories many of us are familiar with. It is an absolutely fantastic podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of listening, I was triggered to think about hierarchy, not as the default, but because people want it there. There are those who believe hierarchy is a &lt;em&gt;requirement&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;preferred state&lt;/em&gt;, something they are willing to invest time and effort into establishing and continuing. The history that Harris provides around Stanford is just this. A story of those seeking to set up a new and alternative hierarchy, one based on some particularly nasty ideologies. It’s also a story of their success and how their narrative has come to dominate global discourse and trends. Harris also points to this story being a great lesson on myth-making because, despite the claims of being a hotbed of counter culture and antiauthoritarianism, Silicon Valley was and is built on the militarism of the US in the global arena. Every missile and drone is powered by the chips and software developed in and by Silicon Valley. The technology we use every day was developed and funded under a regime that was not counter-culture; it was &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; culture. It was powered by an ideology based on dominance and dominion, not free love and peace. Much of the fragility in global supply chains we see today was brought about by the shift to globalisation and offshoring work, which was pioneered in Silicon Valley to skirt US labour laws and from having to deal with unions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other key idea I drew out of the podcast was the idea of &lt;em&gt;hiers&lt;/em&gt;. It wasn’t enough to establish a hierarchy; it had to continue and in order to do that, you had to breed your successors. This is where Stanford fits in. It was established and still is, the incubator for the next generations of leaders in the hierarchy. But it&#39;s important to remember that the incubator of their heirs is based on the underpinnings of eugenics and breeding practices tested on horses at the Palo Alto Stock Farm. Not only was this group of people able to establish new power based on the West Coast away from the dominant familial lines of the East, but they also established a way to continue their lineage and ideology. While perhaps not entirely concerned with the genetics component, Stanford has become a tool for indoctrination into a way of seeing and understanding the world – one that is often completely at odds with the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This disconnect is why no one has &amp;quot;innovated&amp;quot; a solution to hunger or homelessness. Despite having the “greatest minds” and access to infinite amounts of capital, Silicon Valley refuses to engage in real problems, mostly because they see inequality as a functional part of the model, not as a problem. You can’t have a hierarchy without someone on the bottom. You can’t compete if everyone is on the same level. You can’t have anything resembling a meritocracy (despite their prescribed belief) if it’s not what you know but who you know. Stanford and all in its shadow thrive on the inequality of hierarchy, and they will go to all ends to ensure that it continues. And they have bred generations of disciples to their ideology — that this is the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I struggled with the thought that hierarchy was problematic because it was the default method of organisation. What we lacked was imagination for how to do things differently to better suit the way we need to work, particularly in complex domains. The problem was the difficulty in moving anything forward while laden with the inertia of what is easy. Now I can see that there&#39;s another element here: desire. Some people don&#39;t want change because they seek power. Or that they feel they deserve it. It is their right. That part of the problem is that moving beyond the hierarchy is a challenge because the power it bestows won&#39;t be relinquished. That change can only come from prising it from their cold dead hands, and even part of the hierarchy is that there&#39;s an heir apparent, just waiting to step in. Moving beyond the hierarchy is not a change that can happen within an organisation but can only be done by replacing it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Complexity of Learning Design</title>

    <summary>Trying to map out the complexity of learning design and to use the Cynefin framework as a way of thinking about what&#39;s involved.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about learning design as a profession, the kind of work it is, and what we do, and trying to map it to the domains of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/cynefin-framework/&quot;&gt;Cynefin Framework&lt;/a&gt;. This is to help explain what we do as a team to others in the institution and to look at what structures would support our work, especially in an environment of scaled-up development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cynefin Framework contains four domains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chaotic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things in the &lt;strong&gt;Simple&lt;/strong&gt; domain are, for better words, simple. It’s essentially an easy-to-follow process from input to output, with the process being both knowable and controllable. This simplicity usually applies to the process, not necessarily the tools or technology used, so much manufacturing can fall into the simple domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Complicated&lt;/strong&gt; domain requires many more steps in the process. It relates to very complicated work with many steps and stages, but it is still knowable and controllable. It can be helpful to think of the Complicated work as tasks that can be programmed; it might include &lt;a href=&quot;https://heartsoulmachine.com/notes/if-this-then-that/&quot;&gt;if-this-then-that&lt;/a&gt; statements and for-loops, but it can be mapped and has a predictable output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Chaotic&lt;/strong&gt; domain, on the other hand, doesn’t behave predictably. In many cases, the actors, objects and actions aren’t even clear. Inputs don’t necessarily equal outputs. Things don’t make sense, and it’s very challenging to map out what&#39;s possible within the domain with any clarity or reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with the &lt;strong&gt;Complex&lt;/strong&gt; domain. Many actors and forces exist in the Complex domain, and their effect on outputs isn’t predictable. This inconsistency in output is the key to understanding the Complex domain. While a process might be knowable and, in some cases, mappable, even to a programmatic level, how things influence and affect one another isn’t predictable. Small changes can have significant consequences. There are many points of potential behaviour. How things may or may not interact and relate isn’t predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s a clear reason for this unpredictability - &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work that involves groups of people tends to reside in the Complex domain because people themselves are complex. They are individualistic, organic, adaptable and unique in their skill sets, knowledge and behaviours. Every facet of a person will have different impacts on how they work, behave and contribute. So it&#39;s not just that the process is complicated; when you add people into the mix, they create variation, which creates complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reality of Design as a practice and profession – with Learning Design being an application of design practice to a specific context (like web or graphic design). Design is the kind of work that is suited and required for the Complex domain because its nature is to creatively adapt and problem-solve to a change and work with variables and constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at some of the factors that Learning Designers have to work with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alignment to the course and program learning outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different delivery modes and models of teaching and learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The technologies used to deliver the course as a whole and every interaction and activity within it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The need to plan and development of lessons that aid student&#39;s learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help develop content in various media based on each media type&#39;s affordances and constraints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the effectiveness of lessons in student learning based on the application of psychology and learning science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit copy and ensure consistency of terminology across a course and multiple authors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage production timelines across multiple teams and media types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure aesthetic principles are adhered to across the course and program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop universally accessible content and activities for students across devices, access levels and physical capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop assessments that provide evidence of learning that is engaging for students and can provide a spread of marks that reflect student&#39;s different abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Align the course to the institutional graduate attributes and professional qualifications based on external bodies&#39; requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of government standards and practices related to the course and program specifics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that list, you have to add in the roles that they are required to interact with throughout the development of the course:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject matter experts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Course authors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Media production teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video producers and editors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program coordinators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project managers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team managers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their peers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional bodies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each factor and each person involved in the process requires not just an action but an &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;action. That interaction might produce the necessary outcomes and outputs - or it might not because people are Complex. They might be stressed, not in the mood, be sick, with family, hungover, unprepared, or short of time - there are thousands of ways each individual could be affected by their lives and what is going on outside of work, let alone what happens within the job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Complexity I’ve just outlined is for &lt;strong&gt;just one course&lt;/strong&gt;! When you multiply that complexity across multiple courses, a team, a program of study, and faculties and departments, you add multiple complexities. These multipliers of complexity create a relatively new and unique environment to manage. It is an environment with no levers of control and no direct way to manipulate outcomes. Management relies on relationships, negotiation and compromise - elements that traditional management structures struggle with. Within the University environment, where hierarchy reigns supreme, it is a fundamentally different and often incompatible way of working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is why the Cynefin framework is such an important tool - by identifying the domain you are working in; you can adjust your ways of working and the common practices and structures to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where I’ll leave this post. I want to discuss the challenges of working in the Complex domain and unpack what it’s like to manage a team and a range of projects in that space. I’ve also got some suggestions for improving our ways of working in the Complex space to help feed into institutional and management discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Testing the Polestar 2</title>

    <summary>Some thoughts on a two-week practical test of an EV - the Polestar 2.</summary>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I test-drove the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.volvocars.com/au/cars/xc40-electric/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Volvo XC40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt; - their first foray into electric vehicles and the only model locally available to test drive. As our petrol prices ballooned over the last 12 months, I’ve been seriously thinking about making the switch, and with my current lease running out, it seemed like a good time to switch. With a lack of available cars in the country and the inability to test drive many variants, I thought it best to hold off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started to look at travel plans for Christmas, the prices of things began to add up. Rental cars have skyrocketed in expense, going from a couple of hundred dollars to a couple of thousand. I shit you not that the Holden Barina compact was at the low end of $2500 from some companies. Doing a bit of research, I found that Hertz had invested in a fleet of EVs and that this could be an opportunity to test out an EV over a period of time. So I bit the bullet, and my Christmas present to myself was to plonk down the money for two weeks with a Polestar 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WTF is a Polestar?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have more than a passing interest in cars - I love to drive and keep abreast of what’s out there. So, I already knew Polestar was a performance workshop that merged with Volvo and has subsequently turned out its own brand of vehicles. A Polestar is essentially a Volvo in its underpinnings but styled and set up in its own unique way — which honestly differs quite a lot from its parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/1600/1067/app/uploads/2021/11/POLESTAR-2-LRSM-29.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining who and what a Polestar is has been a daily experience pulling into parking lots and chatting with family. I guess this is the lived experience of owning a niche brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s it like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look at, it’s a slightly odd high-riding sedan with a fairly wide and flat profile. The colour is - a bit of a mystery. It’s kind of a grey colour, but it seems to have tints of blue and lilac, depending on the lighting. The car&#39;s lines are fantastic and give the car a sense of speed while demonstrating a solid stance. Big wheels and really nice LED lights around the car finish off a fairly impressive-looking car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/1600/1067/app/uploads/2021/11/POLESTAR-2-LRSM-24.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An oversized central console dominates the inside of the car. It creates a bit of a cockpit feel for the driver, with a large touchscreen at the centre – about the size of an iPad. There aren’t a lot of buttons to play around with - most controls are shifted to the centre screen. This might seem like an issue - it&#39;s just something you need to adapt to, but after a couple of days, you can set things up quickly and efficiently, even when driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carsales.com.au/editorial/details/polestar-2-carsales-car-of-the-year-2021-finalist-132642/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://editorial.pxcrush.net/carsales/general/editorial/polestar2_magnesium_020-5gcm.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;height=682&quot; alt=&quot;Polestar Interior&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a love/hate relationship with this centre console. It&#39;s big and eats up a lot of cabin space. There may be practical reasons for its existence, but it reduces leg space for those who like to man-spread and offers little practical storage. There&#39;s a little shelf for your phone, which needs to be plugged in for Apple CarPlay to work, a single cup holder and a console lid that opens up to - another cupholder. There are a couple of hidden shelves on both the driver and passenger sides for small items - wallet or glasses case. The door pockets are also not particularly practical - unable to hold water bottles vertically, which is a bummer. So upfront, there&#39;s not oodles of space for accoutrement or expected needs - like two cup holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the &#39;cockpit&#39; feel is excellent as a driver. I like the seating position and the way you feel inside the cabin. Everything is well made, with great textures and feel to everything you touch - from the steering wheel, seat fabric, steering wheel, levers and buttons. As the driver, you always feel in control of the car, and everything you need is accessible. The car&#39;s design isn&#39;t open and airy - it&#39;s more closed-in and cocoon-like. Visibility is limited but in a focused way – you see what you need to see. The setup of the mirrors and the additional sensors give you a complete sense of what&#39;s around you and what you need to know. Peripheral visibility is the limiting factor - but to be honest, that often gets in the way of focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a driver&#39;s car. It&#39;s set up for you to get from A to B and to do so in comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How does it drive?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It drives well. Very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model I&#39;ve driven is the single motor version with around 380kms of range. I had doubts about its performance based on the stats - but from a real-world perspective, it&#39;s everything it needs to be and a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&#39;t have the sickening acceleration of a Tesla or the dual-motor variants with a 4-point-something 0-100 speed - but it accelerates handsomely. What&#39;s great about this car is that the acceleration is available at any time - there&#39;s no lag, no gear change - push the accelerator, and there&#39;s instantly more power and speed. Driving through the Blue Mountains on the back roads was so much fun. Accelerating out of corners with instant speed was bliss. The car&#39;s handling was tight and responsive – it&#39;s an absolute joy to drive and throw around corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extends to the practical too - stop-start traffic, highway driving, handling broken roads and potholes - the Polestar does all of these things well. Really well. You&#39;re comfortable the whole time, and you&#39;re not freaking out about the drive in front because of the adaptive cruise control. The car doesn&#39;t shudder when you don&#39;t see the pothole or broken asphalt. The Polestar takes everything in its stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most electric vehicles have an energy recovery system or regenerative braking - a feature that uses the wheels to power the motor and recharge the battery. You don&#39;t get a huge amount of charge out of the process, but it is an interesting driving feature. It essentially provides the car with two ways to slow down: Use the wheels to power the motor and slow the wheels that way, or your standard brakes to slow the wheels down. This dynamic is one of the best features of an EV and creates the possibility of &lt;strong&gt;one-pedal drive&lt;/strong&gt; - similar to driving a Dodgem car – when you press the pedal, you go fast, and when you release, you slow down. You can still use the brake - but you can do most driving using one pedal. I loved this feature and have quickly converted to it. It&#39;s going to be a challenge going back to a normal car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took it out on a short gravel road and had quite an exciting experience using the one-pedal drive. Usually, on gravel, the car is searching for traction and slowing the car down with brakes to corner usually means losing traction. With the regenerative braking in the Polestar it essentially sucks the speed out of the car rather than physically braking, so taking corners was a genuinely strange experience. You don&#39;t lose traction slowing down and getting that noticeable drift, the only time you got that sense was when you accelerated back out of the corner. It was an added element to the driving experience and one I really liked, having done my fair share of backroads and dirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the dual motor version would add that extra grunt and performance, this is not a car that is lacking in that department. The base model will accelerate faster, handle better and be more pleasant to drive than any family sedan. The battery range is adequate. It&#39;s not mind-blowing, but a big part of hiring this car was to look at how you would need to manage the content - and it&#39;s not a concern for most trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Practicalities&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hire car was the &lt;em&gt;standard range single motor&lt;/em&gt; with the &lt;em&gt;Pilot lite&lt;/em&gt; pack. You would want the Pilot pack as it has a range of features that really should be standard at this price point. The pack comes with a neat 360° camera feature, making parking easy. I always struggle with judging the distance behind and in front of the car, so this visual aid was perfect. The adaptive cruise control was also handy, especially in traffic. That sounds odd, using cruise control in the city, but the constant changes in sign-posted speed limits, traffic speed and the plethora of speed cameras and police on the roads make Sydney quite a combative place to drive. The cruise handled this easily, stopping at traffic lights and taking off once the light was green. The lane departure feature was quite aggressive, not something I would use often - except on the freeway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car is a sedan, and the boot isn’t huge. It’s quite flat without a lot of height, so getting a suitcase in on its side (the most convenient) made the cover pop up and the boot unable to shut. It ended up being quite a Tetris challenge to get three suitcases in. It&#39;s not a dealbreaker and not something that would impact everyday use. There is ample space under the boot floor accessible via a lift-up section, but it is an odd shape. It became known as the “ham bay” as there was enough room for a whole leg of ham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Charging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key reasons for hiring the car was to assess the viability of owning an electric vehicle. What changes would you need to make to accommodate an electric vehicle and its need to charge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-reviews/2022-polestar-2-long-range-single-motor-review&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.carexpert.com.au/crop/1600/1067/app/uploads/2021/11/Polestar-2518-1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with — range anxiety is a very real thing. The car was at 100% charge when we picked it up, and I was quite nervous about how quickly that number decreased and the speed it did it. The first leg of our journey took us from Sydney airport down the coast to Jervis Bay. Rather than stick to the highway, we took a few of the backroads as we couldn’t check into our accommodation till 2pm. We used about half the battery that day - and the next couple of days I was a little worried at how things would go. There was no public charging infrastructure where we were staying - the nearest was 40 minutes drive away. That nervousness started to abate as time went on. We ran errands and visited the local sights without issue and made it to the public charger with 17% charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, range anxiety is very real – but it’s something you get over quite quickly. After that first charge I had much more confidence in the car, the range, and the accuracy of its own predictions. The built-in Google Maps has a button to search for chargers nearby. The maps are also scarily accurate with their predicted charge at the destination. So you can navigate with confidence using the car and know what charge you’ll have. I’m not sure if the Polestar app connects in the same way, allowing you to plot a journey away from the car - but that would be a great feature if it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also downloaded and used the PlugShare app - checking in using it and seeing how useful a community-powered tool like this is, as well as the Evie app. Evie and Hertz have done a deal, and charges are free on Evie infrastructure via the RF card attached to the key fob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big learning curves was finding out about the charging infrastructure - which varies quite significantly. The main difference between charging methods is speed - how much charge can go into the car.  My summary of what’s available is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wall plug - the car came with a wall plug cable, so we did two charges like this at the holiday house we were staying at.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charging plug - these outlets are significantly faster than your wall plug but need to be installed. They are often found at a location - like a supermarket, car park or some tourist destinations. They’re often free to use and pump out about 5kW.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purpose Charging - these are actual charging stations with a specifically designed installed and operate similarly to a petrol bowser. Pull up, use the in-built plug and charge away. These are commercial in nature, but at the moment, the NRMA in NSW have made them free, which I took advantage of in Berry. I also used an Evie station located at a shopping mall. Both advertised 50kW, but it seems variable about what you get into the car at the time - but I was getting about 35-45kW.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast Charging - similar to above but significantly faster and with higher output. I tried the Evie station at Seven Hills and was pumping in over 130kW into the car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically these options look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wall - About a day to charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didn’t use these - but I’m assuming they are useful for topping up a charge rather than “filling up”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over an hour to go from below 20% to between 80-90%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32 minutes to go from 17% to 88%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Opinion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to divide this into two - one on the everyday use of an electric car, the other on the Polestar itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right here, today, I would 100% say yes to an electric car. I found the whole experience easy to manage, free of show-stopping issues and overall a really enjoyable driving experience An electric car is an amazing thing in so much as it’s just like driving a normal car - but &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; aspect of it is better. You can accelerate faster, slow down better, feel more in control of the car and lay down as much torque as you need when you need it. It’s an amazing feat of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Polestar. I love the look, and I love the drive, but I had a few practical issues with it. The centre console, for one, but also getting in and out of the car was a bit weird for a person with my height and dimensions. I felt like I should be stepping into the car, but it’s more like sliding across into it - and that’s just a bit weird. Everything else, though, I love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But… at the price point it’s at, there are a few more issues. The Pilot pack is extra, so to is the Plus pack to get all the creature comforts this car didn&#39;t come with. I would expect that if you were going to lay down this amount of money – they’d be included. They are in the Volvo XC40 Recharge, and they want less for it, and you get the dual motors. There’s also the brand new C40 - Volvo&#39;s first fully electric car platform, which is in the same price range. So from that perspective, it’s a hard sell to convince me to put down the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said - if Polestar sharpened up their pricing, I would 100% rethink that opinion, but pricing for electric cars is their big issue at the moment. There are a few cheaper Chinese models coming in the next year - but most electric cars have a luxury price tag and they need to reflect that in their fit and features. I think Volvo get that - but Polestar’s pricing isn’t quite as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if Polestar wants to get in touch and offer me a discount or wants a long-term tester - I would relish the opportunity. Going back to my &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; cars has taken quite a bit of adjustment. There&#39;s a lot I miss about the Polestar!&lt;/p&gt;
