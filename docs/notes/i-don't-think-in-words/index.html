	<div class="p-summary introduction">
		This was published back in 2016 and summarises an issue that I have. It&#39;s been one of the most popular posts on my old blog, which is surprising, but it might point more to the fact that I&#39;m not alone.
	</div>
	

	<p>One of my personal frustrations is my inability to get my thoughts into words. What seems so clear in my head usually comes out as a jumbled mess and needs to be carefully crafted into something that can be communicated. It slows the process down a lot, and an idea often has to spend months dwelling around in various forms, being nibbled at and moulded into shapes before it’s ready to come out.</p>
<p>I thought tonight that it would be great if I could write more… But that’s not really the problem. I write plenty. What I struggle with is the fact that I don’t think in words. My thoughts take a very different form and are something that I struggle to describe.</p>
<p>They are visual and sensory objects to me. They are often pieces that join together – not like a puzzle but as a truth. Complexity is there and can be felt rather than explained. There is a physicality to these thoughts, a real weight and mass. They are solid rather than ephemeral and gossamer. What I struggle with is translating these truths into words. To encode and abstract them into language and structure them in text.</p>
<p>An example is probably my first memory and inclination of this problem. It was back when I was studying at university, and I was trying to think of a project to develop for my major. One of the ideas I had was to map a four-dimensional space. In my mind it was (and is) as clear anything but any attempt to verbalise – even to visualise it is hopeless. I spent a long time with that one, eventually dropping out and heading out into the workforce. There were a number of factors in that decision, but my inability to express an idea scared me – how could I spend time on something that I can’t quite describe?</p>
<p>What tends to come out is not what I see, especially in its initial form. The best comparison is Terry Pratchett’s description of the colour of magic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was octarine [the eighth colour], the colour of magic. It was alive and glowing and vibrant and it was the undisputed pigment of the imagination, because wherever it appeared it was a sign that mere matter was a servant of the powers of the magical mind. It was enchantment itself. But Rincewind always thought it looked a sort of greenish-purple.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s what happens to my ideas when I translate them to words – they become a greenish-purple – a poor representation of my minds eye. An inferior description that does little to capture the truth and true nature of the thought.</p>
