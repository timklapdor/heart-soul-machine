		OK, we are now eleven-twelfths of the year done. It&#39;s been a busy month!
	</div>
	

	<h2>The Vibe</h2>
<p>The job has been busy. I'm representing my colleagues on the new Reference Group for Curriculum Development, and I found out I was co-chairing it as well. In November, I worked across about ten courses, running workshops, developing slide decks, drafting some style recommendations, and building course sites. It was not what I imagined at the start of the year, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Other aspects of work have been a bit dramatic as the process we're working through is starting to unravel under its own weight. I pushed hard early on that the approach wasn't suited for what needed to be done, but higher-ups decided to go with hierarchy over experience, and we're now seeing it officially not working. For example, I, an experienced manager, people leader, and project lead, am now building courses because they won't employ casuals to do that work. And that's because no one set up any systems to capture any data about what work needed to be done, who was doing it, and how much there was. I am sure there is a German word for the situation where schadenfreude includes yourself.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the month ended with some really positive conversations on leadership and the need to change. I hope there is more of that, and that it happens quickly. The idea of doing this for another year is ... schadenfreude?</p>
<p>Clare and I both had some time away from Adelaide â€” she headed up to Sydney to hang out with her Dad and Sister, so Ms 12 and I had some fun hanging out together.  We had our first &quot;family planning&quot; session to work together on what we want to be doing in 2025. The new year is looming, and we will have a teenager starting a new school, so it was good to chat about what that meant, but also what we had as shared goals as a family and how we could work towards them together.</p>
<p>It's November, and I am feeling those strong end-of-year vibes. Although I got close several times this year, I didn't burn myself out. Recognising that has been a win for the year. I am feeling more positive now than I did a year ago. I am hoping to go into 2025 with a plan for the year - rather than recovering for the one just past... so I need to make some time during December for that.</p>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>I also got my turn to be away and headed up to Brisbane for the <a href="https://conference.oeglobal.org/2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OEGlobal Conference</a>. Old friend Alan Levine was part of the OE Global team putting on the show and I figured I would put in a proposal to share some key aspects of my work. I got to give that presentation, <a href="https://heartsoulmachine.com/blog/2024/11-19-an-open-design-system-for-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Open Design System for Learning</a>, on the Thursday and it was great to bring everything together for that session. I've got a lot of value in personally sharing my work, and so this year has seen me take some time out to do that.</p>
<p>The conference was good, but it was surprising that so many of the same issues were present despite the fact that the last time I worked on anything open was probably about seven years ago. The sessions were pretty Library-heavy, as opposed to learning and teaching, which I do understand as a lot of focus has shifted to Open Textbooks and now to Open Journals. I met some really interesting people working on exciting things, so it was a good learning experience.</p>
<p>Brisbane is normally hot and humid at this time of year and it did not disappoint. That said I did enjoy the weather - the lushness that it brings and the absolute joy of watching a thunderstorm (not so much when you're stuck in it!). I do love the skies in Brisbane - they have a drama all to themselves. I also explored a little more of the town this time - heading over to the Valley to hang out with Grant Potter and to Eat Street on the Friday night for some drinks and food. There is one thing that I adore about Queensland, and it is the nighttime culture. It's warm and beautiful and so liveable and pleasant. So it was great to eat, drink and chat those evenings out.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I hired a car and took Alan up into the hinterland. While Brisbane is great â€” the hinterland is spectacular. We didn't have the weather on our side â€“ our morning was a complete washout as it bucketed with rain. So we drove through it North and then looped back through the Glasshouse mountains in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The following week I went to<a href="https://dddadelaide.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> DDD Adelaide</a> and by the time that was finished my brain was full!</p>
<p><img src="/images/frankie.jpg" alt="Frankie on his third birthday"></p>
<p>Worth noting that Frankie turned 3 this month as well. It is hard to think back to when he was a puppy, but flicking back through the photos so much has happened. I was never a dog guy, but I've enjoyed having him around, and yeah, I love him - he's very hard not to!</p>
<h2>Photos</h2>

<h2>Watched</h2>
<p>I spent the start of the month fully immersed in The Expanse - rewatching the TV series and smashing out another audiobook in the series.</p>
<p>I ended it watching the fat suit glory that is <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt15435876/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Penguin</a>. Also viewed <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt6263850/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</a> and <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt12789558/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belfast</a>.</p>
<h2>Listened</h2>
<p>I smashed through the second season of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0jn1f4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Coming Storm</a> which was excellent and the fourth season of <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/expanse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expanse</a> on crop circles.</p>
